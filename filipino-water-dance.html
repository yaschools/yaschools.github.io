                                            Native Footsteps
Edilberto A. Ochea
Let the spirit fly on the old path trodden,
Talikala of yesterday patched footprints;
Footsteps that build personality,
Footsteps that gave color to our Filipinoness;
Rich cultural way of life has opened the eyes,
In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;
The brand of the native brown is the belief in the Creator,
Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;
10
In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;

Ingat was careful in everything he did and wastherefore his father's right hand man He was always helping with the work in the fieldand his parents were very pleased with himOn the other hand, Daskol did hus work sloppily in the absence of a daughter inthe famdy, the housework came to be Daskol's responsibility. He fetched water,cleaned the house and did the cooling. He also did the pounding of the patay that hefather and Ingat harvested Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name Hall ofthe grain he pounded scattered and fall to the ground. Being naturally lazy andimpatient, he did not like the work of pounding nce.One day, Daskol had to pound a preater quantity of palay than wuel He wasirritated because every time he raised the pestle hugher, and every time it hit the sky,the sky would be raised in his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising,When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky hadrisen and it is where it is today(Dolo)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman One day,they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting But because the boneswere very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bonesThe woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky Butwhenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to risehigher It thundered and the sky rose higher sull the postle hit the sley so, thowoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rosa higher. Stillthe pestle but the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher Again, Itthundered and the sky rose as high as coud be. When the woman remembered whatshe had hung, It was too late They became the moon and the stars.(Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low...so low that it could be reached by a stickof ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in sucha way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turri, God could sendhis blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connectionbetween God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need toworkWhenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their requestwas made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam andEve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came thecustom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came toenjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to thechef and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, whowas drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he dartedhis spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. Thisangered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the kves of the people before and after the sky roseUse the organizer below to list down your observationBEFOREAFTER2.3.5.5.​</a>

                            8. Native Footsteps
Edilberto A. Ochea
Let the spirit fly on the old path trodden,
Talikala of yesterday patched footprints;
Footsteps that build personality,
Footsteps that gave color to our Filipinoness;
Rich cultural way of life has opened the eyes,
In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;
The brand of the native brown is the belief in the Creator,
Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;
10
In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;

What's NewThese stories explain why the sky is highly tipino wed stories to explainthe origin / things und phenomena These stories are called legends and they containedrllection the outure and belief the Filipino peopleWhy the Sky lo wych(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat andDaskol lived with their parents on earthAs their names indicate. Ingat was careful in everything he did and wastherefore his father's right hand man He was always helping with the work in the fieldand his parents were very pleased with himOn the other hand, Daskol did hus work sloppily in the absence of a daughter inthe famdy, the housework came to be Daskol's responsibility. He fetched water,cleaned the house and did the cooling. He also did the pounding of the patay that hefather and Ingat harvested Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name Hall ofthe grain he pounded scattered and fall to the ground. Being naturally lazy andimpatient, he did not like the work of pounding nce.One day, Daskol had to pound a preater quantity of palay than wuel He wasirritated because every time he raised the pestle hugher, and every time it hit the sky,the sky would be raised in his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising,When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky hadrisen and it is where it is today(Dolo)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman One day,they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting But because the boneswere very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bonesThe woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky Butwhenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to risehigher It thundered and the sky rose higher sull the postle hit the sley so, thowoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rosa higher. Stillthe pestle but the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher Again, Itthundered and the sky rose as high as coud be. When the woman remembered whatshe had hung, It was too late They became the moon and the stars.(Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low...so low that it could be reached by a stickof ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in sucha way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turri, God could sendhis blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connectionbetween God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need toworkWhenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their requestwas made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam andEve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came thecustom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came toenjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to thechef and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, whowas drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he dartedhis spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. Thisangered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the kves of the people before and after the sky roseUse the organizer below to list down your observationBEFOREAFTER2.3.5.5.​</h2><br />
