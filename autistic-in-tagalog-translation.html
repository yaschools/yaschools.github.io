                                            Case Study  As parent of an autistic child, entering a research study seemed to be a way of not only educating themselves about their son’s condition, but also of furthering research into this complex, behaviorally defined disorder. Researchers told the couple that there is a strong genetic influence for autism since the concordance rate in identical twins is about 75% and only about 5 percent in fraternal twins. In addition, researchers have identified interactions among at least ten candidate’s genes distributed among chromosomes 3, 7, 15 and 17. Generally unaware of the principles of basic genetics, the couple asked a number of interesting questions. As a Geneticist, how would you responds them? 1. How can there be ten candidate genes on only four chromosomes? 2. Since several candidate genes must be on the same chromosomes, will they be transmitted as block of harmful genetic information to future offspring?3. With such an apparently complex genetic condition, what is the likelihood that our next child will also be autistic?4. Is prenatal diagnosis possible during future pregnancies?</a>

And when the child is scared or nervous and throws a tantrum, the mother scolds him and asks if he’s going to be done with his tantrum. What values are the parents of this family missing?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Patience, positivity, kindness, and compassion.  Knowing that the child is autistic the family should have been more patient to him, the parents should have been more understanding with their adoptive child, and encourage their other children as well. Scolding a child with autism isn't an effective tool to discipline.</p><p></p><p>I hope this helps:)</p><p></p><br />

                            20. Case Study  As parent of an autistic child, entering a research study seemed to be a way of not only educating themselves about their son’s condition, but also of furthering research into this complex, behaviorally defined disorder. Researchers told the couple that there is a strong genetic influence for autism since the concordance rate in identical twins is about 75% and only about 5 percent in fraternal twins. In addition, researchers have identified interactions among at least ten candidate’s genes distributed among chromosomes 3, 7, 15 and 17. Generally unaware of the principles of basic genetics, the couple asked a number of interesting questions. As a Geneticist, how would you responds them? 1. How can there be ten candidate genes on only four chromosomes? 2. Since several candidate genes must be on the same chromosomes, will they be transmitted as block of harmful genetic information to future offspring?3. With such an apparently complex genetic condition, what is the likelihood that our next child will also be autistic?4. Is prenatal diagnosis possible during future pregnancies?</h2><br />
