1.
It's been years since I last saw you, But I'm still glad that I met you.
You were once the cause of my euphoria,
But now you're the reason for my dysphoria.
2.
It's not always about "in another life",
But sometimes it's about "in another reality".
Where 'us' exists creating hundreds of memories,
But sadly in this reality there's only you and me.</a>

the coming period. It is a firm’s financial plan. A budget serves two major purposes: a tool for
planning and a tool for control. As a tool for planning, a budget summarizes sales targets, expenses,
and even investments to be made. Since targets are reflected in the budget, then it also serves as a
standard to guide both the top management and department managers. In the course of operations,
budgets become control measures.</a>

I have noticed that I am quite good in teaching people. I am the tutor in every studying session I do with my friends, except for Filipino subjects, where I ask them questions and elaborating the parts they were confused in, this way of studying also helps me remember better since my memory works best when I am physically speaking. Before reaching to education, I also thought about being a medical technologist or nursing but ultimately settled for education since my family does not have enough money for the other two. But now, since COVID-19 happened, it actually helped cement the decision of being a teacher.</a>

A budget is a statement of projected sales, expenses, income, and other financial transactions for
the coming period. It is a firm’s financial plan. A budget serves two major purposes: a tool for
planning and a tool for control. As a tool for planning, a budget summarizes sales targets, expenses,
and even investments to be made. Since targets are reflected in the budget, then it also serves as a
standard to guide both the top management and department managers. In the course of operations,
budgets become control measures.</h2><br />

I have noticed that I am quite good in teaching people. I am the tutor in every studying session I do with my friends, except for Filipino subjects, where I ask them questions and elaborating the parts they were confused in, this way of studying also helps me remember better since my memory works best when I am physically speaking. Before reaching to education, I also thought about being a medical technologist or nursing but ultimately settled for education since my family does not have enough money for the other two. But now, since COVID-19 happened, it actually helped cement the decision of being a teacher.</h2><br />
