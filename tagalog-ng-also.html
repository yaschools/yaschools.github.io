Although we cansee various pictures of Rhinoceros Beetle online,nothing can compare to seeing one up close andpersonalFrom experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it'sreally impossible to get it off easily. The variety found in the Philippines isthe Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle. They may seem formidable and vicious, butappearance can be deceiving.They have sharp claws and those claws can only hurt you if you getpinched by them. Other than that, they are practically harmless. Theyalso have horns and there is a difference in length depending on whetherit's a male or female.From what I understand, it's the strongest insect in the world. I'mnot willing to test the assertion.1. What are the names of the two types of beetles which are found inthe Philippines?2. What variety of beetles do those two types come from?3.

                                            Lesson 12: MAT WEAVING ( pp. 174-175)
➢A mat, banig in Tagalog, is used for
sleeping or sitting on the floor.
➢Banig or brown mat is a traditional
hand-woven mat.
➢ Banig weaving is a genuine treasure
handed down as a tradition or a trade
from one generation to another as it is
widely practiced in the country.
❖In Basey, Samar in the Visayas, weaving has become
one of the major source of livelihood.
❖People of Basey make fine woven mats which are made
of tikog leaves, a special reed grass which grow in
swampy areas along fields. The leaves are dyed with
different strong colors to make beautiful, colorful and
unique designs.
❖Local weavers are usually housewives who want to
have another source of income for the family. They are
traditionally called paraglara.
❖The Samals of the Sulu Archipelago also make their own
mats made of buri leaves.
❖One of the artistic craftsmanship of the Samal tribe in
Laminusa was awarded by the government, the
Manlilikha ng Bayan Award (National Folk Artist) in
1990.
❖The people of the island of Romblon have a unique style
for weaving their own mats that involves delicate lace-like
edges. It is also made out of buri leaves.
❖ Basketry is a form of indigenous art. Like mat weaving, it
has become a good source of living for many Filipinos
living in cultural countries.

Kalayaan (dated January 1896, published March 1896)[3][4]
Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</a>

                                            The Market System The polar alternative to the command system is the mar ket system, or capitalism. The system is characterized by the private ownership of resources and the use of markets  and prices to coordinate and direct economic activity.  Participants act in their own self-interest. Individuals and  businesses seek to achieve their economic goals through  their own decisions regarding work, consumption, or  production. The system allows for the private ownership  of capital, communicates through prices, and coordinates economic activity through markets—places where buyers and sellers come together. Goods and services are produced and resources are supplied by whoever is willing and able to do so. The result is competition among independently  acting buyers and sellers of each product and resource. Thus, economic decision making is widely dispersed. Also,  the high potential monetary rewards create powerful in centives for existing firms to innovate and entrepreneurs  to pioneer new products and processes. In pure capitalism—or laissez-faire capitalism— government’s role would be limited to protecting private  tribution of output, and the organization of production. The government owns most of the business firms, which produce according to government directives. The central planning board determines production goals for each en terprise and specifies the amount of resources to be allo.  pakiexplain naman po sakin ng tagalog. buod po. salamat​</a>

different strong colors to make beautiful, colorful and
unique designs.
❖Local weavers are usually housewives who want to
have another source of income for the family. They are
traditionally called paraglara.
❖The Samals of the Sulu Archipelago also make their own
mats made of buri leaves.
❖One of the artistic craftsmanship of the Samal tribe in

❖The people of the island of Romblon have a unique style
for weaving their own mats that involves delicate lace-like
edges. It is also made out of buri leaves.

Kalayaan (dated January 1896, published March 1896)[3][4]
Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</h2><br />

                            27. The Market System The polar alternative to the command system is the mar ket system, or capitalism. The system is characterized by the private ownership of resources and the use of markets  and prices to coordinate and direct economic activity.  Participants act in their own self-interest. Individuals and  businesses seek to achieve their economic goals through  their own decisions regarding work, consumption, or  production. The system allows for the private ownership  of capital, communicates through prices, and coordinates economic activity through markets—places where buyers and sellers come together. Goods and services are produced and resources are supplied by whoever is willing and able to do so. The result is competition among independently  acting buyers and sellers of each product and resource. Thus, economic decision making is widely dispersed. Also,  the high potential monetary rewards create powerful in centives for existing firms to innovate and entrepreneurs  to pioneer new products and processes. In pure capitalism—or laissez-faire capitalism— government’s role would be limited to protecting private  tribution of output, and the organization of production. The government owns most of the business firms, which produce according to government directives. The central planning board determines production goals for each en terprise and specifies the amount of resources to be allo.  pakiexplain naman po sakin ng tagalog. buod po. salamat​</h2><br />

The story follows the adventures of a mysterious figure known as the "Wandering Jew" in 18th century Calcutta. The Wandering Jew is an old myth about a man who was cursed to wander the earth for eternity, and in this story, he is used as a metaphor for the exploitation of people from different backgrounds and cultures that took place during this time period. Through his journey, he encounters various characters who represent different aspects of life in Calcutta at that time, such as poverty, superstition, and religious intolerance. Ultimately, the Wandering Jew serves as an allegory for how people can be taken advantage of when they are seen as outsiders or "others".<strong> </strong></p><br />
