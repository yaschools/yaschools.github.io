Should Mobile Phones be Banned in Schools?
In the last few years there has been an explosion in the use of new
communications technologies, including mobile phones; it is estimated that over
70% of young people aged 10–14 now own one. Considerable debate has taken
place in the press recently as to whether pupils should be allowed to take their
mobile phones into school.
No one can deny the positive benefits of children communicating freely
with each other, and pupils argue that using a mobile phone to talk to or text
message their friends is simply one way of doing this, using new technology. Many
parents are in favor too, and like the reassurance of knowing their child can be
safer and more independent if they have a mobile phone, since they can contact
them at any time if necessary. They cite the potential risks faced by some children
travelling alone.
However, schools point out that carrying a mobile phone could in itself
make a child more vulnerable to theft or mugging, both on the street and even in
the playground. Police figures confirm that a high proportion of crimes committed
against young people involve thefts of mobile phones. Schools are concerned,
moreover, that allowing pupils to bring their mobiles to school could create a
competitive atmosphere amongst children and result in some children feeling left
out and unvalued. In addition, they claim that pupils’ education would be affected
by the distraction of phones ringing in class. Some doctors fear that children using mobiles could suffer long-term brain
damage. Until this is disproved, it would seem that schools might best protect
their pupils from this and other problems by making them leave their mobile
phones at home.</a>

Should Mobile Phones be Banned in Schools?
In the last few years there has been an explosion in the use of new
communications technologies, including mobile phones; it is estimated that over
70% of young people aged 10–14 now own one. Considerable debate has taken
place in the press recently as to whether pupils should be allowed to take their
mobile phones into school.
No one can deny the positive benefits of children communicating freely
with each other, and pupils argue that using a mobile phone to talk to or text
message their friends is simply one way of doing this, using new technology. Many
parents are in favor too, and like the reassurance of knowing their child can be
safer and more independent if they have a mobile phone, since they can contact
them at any time if necessary. They cite the potential risks faced by some children
travelling alone.
However, schools point out that carrying a mobile phone could in itself
make a child more vulnerable to theft or mugging, both on the street and even in
the playground. Police figures confirm that a high proportion of crimes committed
against young people involve thefts of mobile phones. Schools are concerned,
moreover, that allowing pupils to bring their mobiles to school could create a
competitive atmosphere amongst children and result in some children feeling left
out and unvalued. In addition, they claim that pupils’ education would be affected
by the distraction of phones ringing in class. Some doctors fear that children using mobiles could suffer long-term brain
damage. Until this is disproved, it would seem that schools might best protect
their pupils from this and other problems by making them leave their mobile
phones at home.</h2><br />
