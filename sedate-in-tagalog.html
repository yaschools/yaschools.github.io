                                            On A House About To Crumble by Ophelia dimalanta
sedate for all its lumps and bumps of wear and tear this staid and sullen structure perks up for its final flaunt of dignity and agelessness to bow now gracefully to time. It must go splitting beams squeaking rafters And falling eaves hugging to itself Its secret soot and desuetude Womanlike sinister in its sensual passing.
She has had her day Weathering and warding off by turns Telling blows of seasons violence And passions weighing heavy upon Her spires even as parts of her Defy reject heavy and mystic With velvet privacies and promises Withheld withdrawn now squant buddhalike Remote she purges her remaining lustral Fires within her visionary crouch For who will not unflex her rigid and Ancient stance tap her forage through Her waning dimly petering off halls?
She must have to go and soon.
Her corridors ring spectral and musty With overhanging shadows and dripping Echoes of remembered loves and hates. Someday soon she knows In her awaited second springing And with a vengance She will come alive again Far abroad woman deathless Under a copper-colored sky Of some Tahitian shores Quaint vermillion trees
Achingly arched boughs Formidable with fruit And gently glowing presence
Sweeping across her old ancestral threshold
Towards rooms and rooms Tenderly spewing his glitter there Where she at last at last
Empowering overwhelming A gauguin vahine heaving
Imbrowned with native grace And sun-fullfillment
May now finally flower up again In shining deathless calm

                                            There are few subjects that can stir up stronger emotions among doctors, scientists, researchers, policy makers, and the public than medical marijuana. Is it safe? Should it be legal? Decriminalized? Has its effectiveness been proven? What conditions is it useful for? Is it addictive? How do we keep it out of the hands of teenagers? Is it really the "wonder drug" that people claim it is? Is medical marijuana just a ploy to legalize marijuana in general? These are just a few of the excellent questions around this subject, questions that I am going to studiously avoid so we can focus on two specific areas: why do patients find it useful, and how can they discuss it with their doctor? Marijuana is currently legal, on the state level, in 29 states, and in Washington, DC. It is still illegal from the federal government’s perspective. The Obama administration did not make prosecuting medical marijuana even a minor priority. President Donald Trump promised not to interfere with people who use medical marijuana, though his administration is currently threatening to reverse this policy. About 85% of Americans support legalizing medical marijuana, and it is estimated that at least several million Americans currently use it. Marijuana without the high Least controversial is the extract from the hemp plant known as CBD (which stands for cannabidiol) because this component of marijuana has little, if any, intoxicating properties. Marijuana itself has more than 100 active components. THC (which stands for tetrahydrocannabinol) is the chemical that causes the "high" that goes along with marijuana consumption. CBD-dominant strains have little or no THC, so patients report very little if any alteration in consciousness. Patients do, however, report many benefits of CBD, from relieving insomnia, anxiety, spasticity, and pain to treating potentially life-threatening conditions such as epilepsy. One particular form of childhood epilepsy called Dravet syndrome is almost impossible to control but responds dramatically to a CBD-dominant strain of marijuana called Charlotte’s Web. The videos of this are dramatic. Uses of medical marijuana The most common use for medical marijuana in the United States is for pain control. While marijuana isn’t strong enough for severe pain (for example, post-surgical pain or a broken bone), it is quite effective for the chronic pain that plagues millions of Americans, especially as they age. Part of its allure is that it is clearly safer than opiates (it is impossible to overdose on and far less addictive) and it can take the place of NSAIDs such as Advil or Aleve, if people can’t take them due to problems with their kidneys or ulcers or GERD. In particular, marijuana appears to ease the pain of multiple sclerosis, and nerve pain in general. This is an area where few other options exist, and those that do, such as Neurontin, Lyrica, or opiates are highly sedating. Patients claim that marijuana allows them to resume their previous activities without feeling completely out of it and disengaged. Protect yourself from the damage of chronic inflammation. Science has proven that chronic, low-grade inflammation can turn into a silent killer that contributes to cardiovas­cular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes and other conditions. Get simple tips to fight inflammation and stay healthy -- from Harvard Medical School experts. LEARN MORE View Protect yourself from the damage of chronic inflammation. Along these lines, marijuana is said to be a fantastic muscle relaxant, and people swear by its ability to lessen tremors in Parkinson’s disease. I have also heard of its use quite successfully for fibromyalgia, endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, and most other conditions where the final common pathway is chronic pain. Marijuana is also used to manage nausea and weight loss and can be used to treat glaucoma. A highly promising area of research is its use for PTSD in veterans who are returning from combat zones. Many veterans and their therapists report drastic improvement and clamor for more studies, and for a loosening of governmental restrictions on its study. Medical marijuana is also reported to help patients suffering from pain and wasting syndrome associated with HIV, as well as irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn’s disease. This is not intended to be an inclusive list, but rather to give a brief survey of the types of conditions for which medical marijuana can provide relief. As with all remedies, claims of effectiveness should be critically evaluated and treated with caution.​pls: paki summary plszz</a>

                            12. On A House About To Crumble by Ophelia dimalanta
sedate for all its lumps and bumps of wear and tear this staid and sullen structure perks up for its final flaunt of dignity and agelessness to bow now gracefully to time. It must go splitting beams squeaking rafters And falling eaves hugging to itself Its secret soot and desuetude Womanlike sinister in its sensual passing.
She has had her day Weathering and warding off by turns Telling blows of seasons violence And passions weighing heavy upon Her spires even as parts of her Defy reject heavy and mystic With velvet privacies and promises Withheld withdrawn now squant buddhalike Remote she purges her remaining lustral Fires within her visionary crouch For who will not unflex her rigid and Ancient stance tap her forage through Her waning dimly petering off halls?
She must have to go and soon.
Her corridors ring spectral and musty With overhanging shadows and dripping Echoes of remembered loves and hates. Someday soon she knows In her awaited second springing And with a vengance She will come alive again Far abroad woman deathless Under a copper-colored sky Of some Tahitian shores Quaint vermillion trees
Achingly arched boughs Formidable with fruit And gently glowing presence
Sweeping across her old ancestral threshold
Towards rooms and rooms Tenderly spewing his glitter there Where she at last at last
Empowering overwhelming A gauguin vahine heaving
Imbrowned with native grace And sun-fullfillment
May now finally flower up again In shining deathless calm

                            16. There are few subjects that can stir up stronger emotions among doctors, scientists, researchers, policy makers, and the public than medical marijuana. Is it safe? Should it be legal? Decriminalized? Has its effectiveness been proven? What conditions is it useful for? Is it addictive? How do we keep it out of the hands of teenagers? Is it really the "wonder drug" that people claim it is? Is medical marijuana just a ploy to legalize marijuana in general? These are just a few of the excellent questions around this subject, questions that I am going to studiously avoid so we can focus on two specific areas: why do patients find it useful, and how can they discuss it with their doctor? Marijuana is currently legal, on the state level, in 29 states, and in Washington, DC. It is still illegal from the federal government’s perspective. The Obama administration did not make prosecuting medical marijuana even a minor priority. President Donald Trump promised not to interfere with people who use medical marijuana, though his administration is currently threatening to reverse this policy. About 85% of Americans support legalizing medical marijuana, and it is estimated that at least several million Americans currently use it. Marijuana without the high Least controversial is the extract from the hemp plant known as CBD (which stands for cannabidiol) because this component of marijuana has little, if any, intoxicating properties. Marijuana itself has more than 100 active components. THC (which stands for tetrahydrocannabinol) is the chemical that causes the "high" that goes along with marijuana consumption. CBD-dominant strains have little or no THC, so patients report very little if any alteration in consciousness. Patients do, however, report many benefits of CBD, from relieving insomnia, anxiety, spasticity, and pain to treating potentially life-threatening conditions such as epilepsy. One particular form of childhood epilepsy called Dravet syndrome is almost impossible to control but responds dramatically to a CBD-dominant strain of marijuana called Charlotte’s Web. The videos of this are dramatic. Uses of medical marijuana The most common use for medical marijuana in the United States is for pain control. While marijuana isn’t strong enough for severe pain (for example, post-surgical pain or a broken bone), it is quite effective for the chronic pain that plagues millions of Americans, especially as they age. Part of its allure is that it is clearly safer than opiates (it is impossible to overdose on and far less addictive) and it can take the place of NSAIDs such as Advil or Aleve, if people can’t take them due to problems with their kidneys or ulcers or GERD. In particular, marijuana appears to ease the pain of multiple sclerosis, and nerve pain in general. This is an area where few other options exist, and those that do, such as Neurontin, Lyrica, or opiates are highly sedating. Patients claim that marijuana allows them to resume their previous activities without feeling completely out of it and disengaged. Protect yourself from the damage of chronic inflammation.

Along these lines, marijuana is said to be a fantastic muscle relaxant, and people swear by its ability to lessen tremors in Parkinson’s disease. I have also heard of its use quite successfully for fibromyalgia, endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, and most other conditions where the final common pathway is chronic pain. Marijuana is also used to manage nausea and weight loss and can be used to treat glaucoma. A highly promising area of research is its use for PTSD in veterans who are returning from combat zones. Many veterans and their therapists report drastic improvement and clamor for more studies, and for a loosening of governmental restrictions on its study. Medical marijuana is also reported to help patients suffering from pain and wasting syndrome associated with HIV, as well as irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn’s disease. This is not intended to be an inclusive list, but rather to give a brief survey of the types of conditions for which medical marijuana can provide relief. As with all remedies, claims of effectiveness should be critically evaluated and treated with caution.​pls: paki summary plszz</h2><br />
