                        MAKING A STAND AND WRITING AN OPINION
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>Not all Filipino families show strong ties, some are broken and with deep familial issues.
Global warming does affect people’s daily activities because people tend to match their activities with the weather and climate.
Rich people are not always happy, in fact, rich people are more likely to be depressed than poor people.
Not all Filipinos are hospitable, some prefer not having and are rude to visitors.
Most Filipinos want to live elsewhere not in the Philippines because of the limited opportunities the country has to offer.

Ata kasi amraming cases ng sakitsa pilipinas</p><p></p><p>5.Yes bansa natin to eh</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Filipinos are known for having strong and close family ties. They place high regard and put importance on their family before anything else. They work all day and do all they can to feed and provide for their family. In other countries, when a person turned 18, he/she can live away from his/her family. So i must say Filipino families have strong family ties</p><p>2. These changes have led to the emergence of large-scale environmental hazards to human health; such as extreme weather, ozone depletion, increased danger of wildfires, loss of biodiversity, stresses to food-producing systems, and the global spread of infectious diseases. So the global warming affect people</p><p>3. It is my experience that rich people are generally unhappier compared to poor people, although richer people have more comfort and security at their disposal. But the rich are still insecure and they want to become richer or they compare themselves with others who are still richer. They usually live an artificial life bereft of simplicity. Pleasures of life make then unhealthy both mentally and physically and they cannot enjoy life as they should</p><p>4. In my opinion, Filipinos are a very hospitable and friendly people. They always smile no matter how they feel. If meeting someone for the first time, it would be good to smile at the person before you even start a conversation</p><p>5. i think not all filipinos especially does who are suffering here or need some big salary. they want to go to the other country to give them a satisfaction in life. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
