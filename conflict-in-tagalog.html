Society ensures harmony and cooperation among individuals in spite of their occasional conflicts and tensions. 5. You can have individuals without society, but society is nothing more than a group of individuals. Try to imagine a society made up of nobody. Therefore the individual is more important, as society is not a thing, just an interacting set of individuals, each properly seeking their own interests. ​</a>

This sociological perspective is the opposite of the latter. Karl Marx viewed social stratification as creation of inequality between the rich and the poor, or the powerful versus the powerless.

They can enjoy the luxury of life because they earn billions of money. However, proletariats are the working class earned skimpy wages and experiencing isolation to the society. The very essence of life is to enjoy it with loved ones. However, 'working class did not experience this joy because they are isolated to do the labor for long hours each day to earn money at the end of the month. Marx argued that proletariats were oppressed by the money-hungry bourgeois.

EARLY PHILIPPINE LITERATURE (an excerpt) by Dr. Lilla Quindoza-Santiago The early inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had a native alphabet or syllabory which among the Tagalogs was called baybayin, an inscription akin to Sanskrit. It was through the baybayin that literary forms such as songs, riddles and proverbs, lyric and short poems as well as parts of epic poems were written. The bulk of these early literature however was just passed on through oral recitation and Incantation and were transcribed into the Roman alphabet only centuries later by Spanish chroniclers and other scholars. It is believed that replacement of the baybayin by the Roman alphabet must have obliterated a significant aspect of indigenous Philippine literature. 1. The excerpt above is an example of a/an... A.

History of Carmona In the late 16th century, a Spanish colonial resettlement program was implemented across wide areas of what came to be known as the province of (EXAMPLE) CAVITE. The program was designed to integrate the Filipinos into the religious and political institutions of the Spaniards. (1)__________ was first established as a mission town in 1595. Together with the other mission towns in the province, it became one of the centers of religious and economic activities in the first centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Carmona used to be a barrio of the Mission Town of Silang. It was locally known as "(2)_____________ "", a tagalog word for plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. At that time, this barrio was just a small farming community with a very small population. As its population rapidly increased, religious and political separation from the town of Silang was later sought from Spain. Eventually, it became an independent municipality on February 20, 1857 by virtue of the Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de (5)__________ The name (3_______) was adopted as a sign of gratitude to the Spanish officials who influenced the Central Government at the time of separation of the barrio. With boundaries properly delineated and a church established, it started its own religious and political administration. The people of Carmona have actively participated in the revolution against the Spaniards. It also witnessed the Filipinos' resistance against the Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation, some of Carmona's prominent houses were used as Japanese headquarters while the hills became the stronghold of Filipino revolutionaries After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions or land conflicts.​</a>

Subukang isipin ang isang lipunan na binubuo ng walang tao.

                        <p><strong>Answer:ALAMAT NG ROSAS</strong></p><p>Noong unang panahon sa isang malayong nayon, ay may isang dalaga na nagngangalang Rosa na kilala dahil sa natatangi nitong ganda at dahil na rin sa kanyang mapupulang mga pisngi, kung kaya't pinagkakag- uluhan si Rosa ng mga kalalakihan.
</p><p>
</p><p>Isang araw nang dumating ng bahay si Rosa ay nakita niya ang isa sa kanyang mga manililigaw na si Antonio na kausap ang kanyang mga magulang at humihing ng pahintulot na manligaw kay Rosa kung saan ay masaya naman siyang pinayagan ng mga magulang ni Rosa at dahil na rin sa rason na si Antonio lamang ang lalaking unang umakyat ng ligaw sa kanila. Ang kinakailangan lang naman na gawin ni Antonio ay ang mapatunayan ang sarili kay Rosa at pasiyahin ito.
</p><p>
</p><p>Iyon ang naghimok kay Antonio, kaya naman ay pinagsilbihan niya ang pamilya ni Rosa sa pamamagitan ng dote. Lubos namang natuwa ang mga magulang ni Rosa, lalong-lalo na ang dalaga na unti-unti ay nahuhulog na ang loob sa masugid na binata.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sa araw na kung saan ay dapat sanang sagutin ni Rosa ang kanyang manliligaw ay doon rin siya labis na nagtaka kung bakit wala pa ito. Doon din niya nalaman na pinaglalaruan lang pala siya ni Antonio nang marining niya ito habang kausap ang kanyang mga kaibigan. Parang pinagsakluban ng langit at lupa si Rosa sa kanyang narining. Nadurog ang kanyang puso sa kanyang unang pag-ibig. Hindi tumigil ang pag-iyak ni Rosa habang siya ay bumalik sa kaniang bahay. Nag-aalala naman siyang tinanong nang kanyang mga magulang pero hindi sumagot ang dalaga. Kinabukasan ay hindi na nakita si Rosa at pati na rin sa susunod na mga araw.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Isang araw, ay nabalitaan na may kakaibang halaman na tumubo sa dapat sanang tagpuan nina Rosa at Antonio. Tinawag ang halaman na rosas dahil ang pulang kulay nang  bulaklak ay nagsisilbing paalala sa mga mapupulang pisngi ni Rosa. Ang naiiba lamang ay ang tinik na napapalibot sa halaman na pinapaniwalaan na si Rosa na nagsasabing wala sinumon  ang makakakuha sa magandang bulaklak na hindi nasasaktan.

                            11. CONFLICT THEORY
This sociological perspective is the opposite of the latter. Karl Marx viewed social stratification as creation of inequality between the rich and the poor, or the powerful versus the powerless. Let's say for example: The bourgeois capitalists owning high-producing businesses or factories and hire people who work for them. They can enjoy the luxury of life because they earn billions of money. However, proletariats are the working class earned skimpy wages and experiencing isolation to the society. The very essence of life is to enjoy it with loved ones. However, 'working class did not experience this joy because they are isolated to do the labor for long hours each day to earn money at the end of the month. Marx argued that proletariats were oppressed by the money-hungry bourgeois.

EARLY PHILIPPINE LITERATURE (an excerpt) by Dr. Lilla Quindoza-Santiago The early inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had a native alphabet or syllabory which among the Tagalogs was called baybayin, an inscription akin to Sanskrit. It was through the baybayin that literary forms such as songs, riddles and proverbs, lyric and short poems as well as parts of epic poems were written. The bulk of these early literature however was just passed on through oral recitation and Incantation and were transcribed into the Roman alphabet only centuries later by Spanish chroniclers and other scholars. It is believed that replacement of the baybayin by the Roman alphabet must have obliterated a significant aspect of indigenous Philippine literature. 1. The excerpt above is an example of a/an... A.

Ngunit sa isang video address noong Linggo, sinabi ng embattled leader ng Ukraine na hindi niya isasakripisyo ang integridad ng teritoryo ng kanyang bansa bago ang isang bagong round ng usapang pangkapayapaan sa Russia na nakatakdang maganap ngayong linggo sa Turkey. Ang Kremlin ay nag-alok ng kaunting pag-asa para sa napipintong pagwawakas ng mapangwasak na tunggalian, kung saan ang militar ng Moscow ay lumalago nang higit na nakatuon sa pagtalo sa mga pwersa ng Ukraine sa silangan at tumataas ang pangamba na maaaring subukan nitong hatiin ang bansa sa dalawa kung magtagumpay ito. Sinabi ni Pangulong Joe Biden noong Lunes na pinanindigan niya ang mga pahayag na ginawa niya noong katapusan ng linggo - na binibigyang kahulugan ng marami bilang panawagan para sa pagbabago ng rehimen sa Russia - habang patuloy na umuugong ang pagbagsak. Sinabi ni Biden na ang Pangulo ng Russia na si Vladimir Putin ay "hindi maaaring manatili sa kapangyarihan," bagama't ang Kalihim ng Estado na si Antony Blinken ay kabilang sa mga opisyal ng U.S. upang subukan at linawin ang pahayag.</p><p></p><br />
