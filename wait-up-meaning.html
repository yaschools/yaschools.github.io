                                            1 It was Saturday. I woke up early and felt very excited. 2 I couldn’t
wait for the day to be over soon, 3 I wished it was afternoon already. 4 It’s
a special day of the week. 5 We called it "The Lord’s Day." 6 My whole
family has a Catholic faith, but we chose to practice this kind of gathering
every Saturday to manifest our strong faith to God. 7 It’s a simple
celebration which includes a little prayer ceremony and a banquet. 8
It’s the time for praising and communicating with God and at the same time, be
with the whole family on a dinner.

                                            space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers. Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city. The phase out doesn't mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there. Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules sot they don't have to clog loading/ unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn't have to wait long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience. Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips. Use the Pasig River. They Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road.

Patience is difined to be a person's ability to wait something out or endure something tedious, without getting riled up. It takes a lot of patience to wait for your braces to come off, to deal with a toddler's temper tantrum, or to build a house out of toothpicks. Having patience means you can remain calm, even when you've been waiting forever or dealing with something painstakingly slow or trying to teach someone how to do something and they just don't get it. It involves acceptance and tolerance, and is usually easier to have when there's something in it for you at the end. That could be a goal you've been slowly working to achieve, or just lower blood pressure.</a>

                            16. space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers. Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city. The phase out doesn't mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there. Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules sot they don't have to clog loading/ unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn't have to wait long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience. Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips. Use the Pasig River. They Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road.

                        <p></p><p></p><p>The idea in the reading text that I agree with the least is the complete phase-out of jeepneys in Metro Manila. While it is true that jeepneys take up more road space and consume more fuel for the number of passengers they can accommodate, they still serve a vital role in providing transportation in areas with limited options. Instead of completely phasing out jeepneys, a more practical solution would be to regulate their routes and ensure they are only used in areas where they are most needed. Additionally, efforts could be made to modernize jeepneys to make them more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly.</p><br />

                            21. please,Write a concluding sentence for the following passage :
Patience is difined to be a person's ability to wait something out or endure something tedious, without getting riled up. It takes a lot of patience to wait for your braces to come off, to deal with a toddler's temper tantrum, or to build a house out of toothpicks. Having patience means you can remain calm, even when you've been waiting forever or dealing with something painstakingly slow or trying to teach someone how to do something and they just don't get it. It involves acceptance and tolerance, and is usually easier to have when there's something in it for you at the end. That could be a goal you've been slowly working to achieve, or just lower blood pressure.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As expressed it is frustrating and the feeling is not very nice, Though it is something to keep, the capacity to accept or tolerate delay, trouble, or suffering without getting angry or upset is hard to master but definitely worth improving in. We all are growing and learning to accept the worst to come and having to have a high level of patience is useful in the long run.  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

What makes you say so? ____________________________________________________________________________________________5. What stories do you like most? What is in these stories that you like? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. A good book has a unique plot, well-made characters and gives us the feels. Characteristics of a good book is the emotions that the writer wants to reach us, the writer wanted us to feel what he/she feels, we wanted to relate, to connect in the story, and to feel that happiness.</p><p></p><p>2. For me, I prefer reading books. Because in books it has a unique way of creating the story and the caracters has a well-developed attitude. And when I read books, I feel like I'm being connected to it or attached to it, I feel like I am inside the story and I am the main character in it.</p><p></p><p>3. Escape means that you want to find something that is different from the reality, just like reading books. You read books to escape reality, you wanted to be inside the story because in books everything is possible whether you fall in love with a gangster or surviving a plane crash and so on. No, the girls are not running away. It simply means that we wanted to escape from the hard things we endured or overcome, it means that we just wanted to chill and escape from our problems.</p><p></p><p>4. Liza. Because just like Liza said she wanted to escape, and so reading books is her escape.</p><p></p><p>5. There is a lot actually, but I'll just give two. These are If I fall and I'm inlove with a gamer. In If I fall, the stories tells us that even if you are different, there will always be a person who will love you, who will completely accept you. (Spoiler!) And in the end the girl doesn't choose anyone from the both guys who loves her because she wanted to make decisions for herself and she is thankful that someone likes her for who she is and what she is. In I'm inlove with a gamer, what I realized in here is that even if you are completely different or not nice, there will always be a person who will change you and will accept you. And even if there are many problems they have encountered, they never give up. They will fight for their love and fight for who they love.</p><br />
