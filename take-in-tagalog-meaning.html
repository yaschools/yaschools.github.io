It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</a>

                            17. So, what do you notice with each pair in every item?

It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</h2><br />
