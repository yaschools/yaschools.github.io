( 20 points ) 3 NURSES TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 AFTER GETTING VACCINE        Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19. Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus a day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in.      Filipino Nurses United President Maristella Abenojar says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccine on March 1st and even administered vaccines or assisted in the immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solante explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That’s when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help fight the infection.        Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder them from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite limited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor’s assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. – Carolyn Bonquin, CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021 Answer the following : 1.

                                            The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

                                            The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

( 20 points ) 3 NURSES TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 AFTER GETTING VACCINE        Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19. Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus a day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in.      Filipino Nurses United President Maristella Abenojar says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccine on March 1st and even administered vaccines or assisted in the immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solante explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That’s when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help fight the infection.        Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder them from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite limited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor’s assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. – Carolyn Bonquin, CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021 Answer the following : 1.

                            8. The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

                            16. The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.
