inhabitants were the Negritos, the country's aborigines. About 3,000 years ago,
successive waves of migration brought seafaring Indonisians and Malays to the
Philippine shores. While the Negritos were dark, the Indonisians had a fairer skin and
the Malays were brown. The Negritos were short with flat nose and kinky hair, but the
Indonisians were tall and had relatively high-bridged noses. These were the ancestors
of the present Christian and Muslim Filipinos.

                                            I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call "the danger of the single story." I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So, I was an early reader. And what I read were British and American children's books. I was also an early writer. And when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading. All my characters were white and blue-eyed. They played in the snow. They ate apples. (Laughter) And they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was that the sun had come out. (Laughter) Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow. We ate mangoes. And we never talked about the weather because there was no need to. My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was. (Laughter) And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story. What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books, by their very nature, had to have foreigners in them, and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available. And they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books. But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized. Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So, what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are Excerpt from TED Talk, The Danger of a Single Story, by Chimamanda Adichiewhat's the answer ​</a>

These are barbarians and of poor capacity. What can you say about this observation of de Morga? Are they accurate and objective? Why?a. Yes, because they don’t have an organized form of government, no formal schooling, dressed in their primitive attire and have no concept about their self and culture.b. Yes, because European people are more advanced in their science and technology. They are more civilized and educated.c. No, because their judgement is only based on their own observation and used their own culture as basis of comparison.d. No, because their observations do not conform with the ethnographic method used by anthropologists to better understand others’ culture.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If one parent has straight hair and the other parent wavy hair, what is the phenotype (and genotype) ratio for their offspring?</p><p>There are multiple factors that go into the way hair looks (phenotpe, which is how the genes are expressed, or “look"), but if straight hair is dominant and wavy hair is recessive, which is basically how it works, let's assign “H” for the straght hair gene and “h” for the wavy hair gene.</p><p></p><p>The wavy-haired parent would have to have a genotype of hh, since the phenotype (wavy hair is the result of a recessive gene, and they would have to have the genotype (one from each parent) be hh. The parent with the phenotype of straight hair could have a genotype of HH or Hh, because there only has to be one dominant gene to have straight hair. So the genotypic and phenotypic results possible are:</p><p></p><p>HH x hh = 100% Hh genotype, 100% straight hair phenotype.</p><p></p><p>Hh x hh= 50% chance would be Hh genotype and straight hair phenotype, 50 % hh genotype and wavy hair phenotype.</p><p></p><p>Curly hair (C) is incompletely dominant over straight hair (S). The heterozygous genotype expresses a wavy hair phenotype. A man with curly hair marries a female with straight hair. What is the genotypic and phenotypic ratio of their children?</p><p>Assuming it’s as simple as you suggest (I very much doubt it is, but for the sake of argument), then the curly-haired man would have to be CC, the straight-haired woman SS, so their children would all be wavy-haired.</p><p></p><p>For completeness, a wavy-haired person with a curly-haired person would produce half curly-haired and half wavy-haired children, and similarly a wavy-haired and straight-haired person would produce half wavy-haired and half straight-haired. Finally, two wavy-haired people would produce one quarter straight-haired, one quarter curly-haired and one half wavy-haired children.</p><p></p><br />

successive waves of migration brought seafaring Indonisians and Malays to the
Philippine shores. While the Negritos were dark, the Indonisians had a fairer skin and
the Malays were brown. The Negritos were short with flat nose and kinky hair, but the
Indonisians were tall and had relatively high-bridged noses. These were the ancestors

                            8. I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call "the danger of the single story." I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So, I was an early reader. And what I read were British and American children's books. I was also an early writer. And when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading. All my characters were white and blue-eyed. They played in the snow. They ate apples. (Laughter) And they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was that the sun had come out. (Laughter) Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow. We ate mangoes. And we never talked about the weather because there was no need to. My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was. (Laughter) And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story. What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books, by their very nature, had to have foreigners in them, and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available. And they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books. But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized. Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So, what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are Excerpt from TED Talk, The Danger of a Single Story, by Chimamanda Adichiewhat's the answer ​</h2><br />
