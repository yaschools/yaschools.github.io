                        <p>Ang Parañaque ay itinatag noong 1572, sa kadahilanang ang lugar ay malapit sa dagat, ang mga Paraqueños (Parañaquense) ay nakipagkalakalan sa mga Intsik, Indones, Indians at Malayans. Noong panahong iyon ang pangunahing hanapbuhay ay ang paggawa ng asin, pangingisda, pagtatanim ng bigas, paggawa ng sapatos, paggawa ng tsinelas at paghahabi. Ang komunidad ay pinamumunuan ng cabeza de barangay, isang kanluraning bersyon ng mga lokal na tagapamuno at ang mga principalia bilang mga lokal na aristokrata, isang napaka-matibay na institusyon sa lipunan dahil sila ay ang mga kalimitang gumaganap sa mga pampolitikang posisyon. Sila ay makatwiran at tagapamagitan ng pangangailangan ng mga mga mananakop na Espanyol. Ang edukasyon ay limitado para sa principalia lamang dahil sila lang ang may kakayahang magbayad para rito. Ang naitalang simula ng Palanyag ay nagsimula noong 1580 nang si Fr. Diego de Espinar, isang misyonerong Augustinian, ay hinirang na tagapamahala ng kumbento o relihiyosong bahay ng bayan. Bilang residenteng pari, siya ay nagtatag ng bahay ng misyon doon, na may hurisdiksiyon na umaabot hanggang sa Kawit sa lalawigan ng Cavite. Ang Konseho ng Definitors (o konseho ng mga pinuno ng relihiyon order) noong ika-11 Mayo 1580, ay tinanggap ng Palanyag bilang isang malayang bayan. Ang larawan ng patrona ng Palanyag na si Nuestra Señora del Buensuceso, ay dinala sa St. Andrew's Church sa La Huerta noong 1625.</p><br />
