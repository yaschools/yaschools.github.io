Option B will allow the applicant to receive just P2500.00 on the first month but the stipend will increase by P250 each month. Bea took the option A while Pete took Option B. Assuming that both students are frugal and they save exactly half of their total stipend, after how many months will Pete have more monthly savings from their stipends than Bea?​</a>

By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.
Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of Reading
I have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.
He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.
It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.
I am this kid.

They are required to have a profit of at least ₱200.00 by the end of the 3rd quarter. It costs Audrey ₱3.75 to make one yema and she could sell it for ₱5.00. At least how many yemas should Audrey sell to surpass the quota?2. Jessica loves rabbits so she enrolled herself in the Agriculture elective in her senior year. Their teacher required them to build a fence for a rectangular rabbit enclosure whose length is 1 meter less than twice its width. They are only given 16 meters of fencing and they can’t afford to buy more. What is the area of the largest possible enclosure that she can build with the given resources?3. A Physics teacher rolls a ball influenced by air friction and the velocity of the ball (V) is = 40 − 16, where is in seconds. At what time duration will the velocity of the ball be between 16 and 32 feet per second?4. A new scholarship program has just been opened. Passers are given two choices for their monthly stipend scheme. Option A will allow the applicant to receive a fixed stipend of ₱4000.00 a month. Option B will allow the applicant to receive just ₱2500.00 on the first month but the stipend will increase by ₱250 each month. Bea took the option A while Pete took Option B. Assuming that both students are frugal and they save exactly half of their total stipend, after how many months will Pete have more monthly savings from their stipends than Bea?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. Let x be the number of yemas Audrey needs to sell to surpass the quota.</p><p>The profit for one yema is ₱5.00 - ₱3.75 = ₱1.25.</p><p></p><p>So, Audrey's total profit for selling x yemas is 1.25x.</p><p></p><p>To surpass the quota of ₱200.00, we must have:</p><p></p><p>1.25x ≥ 200</p><p></p><p>Solving for x, we get:</p><p></p><p>x ≥ 160</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Audrey should sell at least 160 yemas to surpass the quota.</p><p></p><p>2. Let w be the width of the rectangular rabbit enclosure.</p><p>From the problem, we know that the length is 1 meter less than twice the width, or:</p><p></p><p>length = 2w - 1</p><p></p><p>The total length of fencing is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle, which is:</p><p></p><p>2(length + width) = 2(2w - 1 + w) = 6w - 2</p><p></p><p>We are given that this perimeter is equal to 16 meters, so:</p><p></p><p>6w - 2 = 16</p><p></p><p>Solving for w, we get:</p><p></p><p>w = 3</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the width of the enclosure is 3 meters, and the length is:</p><p></p><p>length = 2w - 1 = 2(3) - 1 = 5 meters</p><p></p><p>The area of the enclosure is:</p><p></p><p>area = length x width = 5 x 3 = 15 square meters</p><p></p><p>So, the largest possible enclosure that Jessica can build with the given resources has an area of 15 square meters.</p><p></p><p>3. We are given that the velocity of the ball is given by the formula V = 40 - 16t, where t is in seconds.</p><p>To find the time duration when the velocity is between 16 and 32 feet per second, we need to solve the inequality:</p><p></p><p>16 ≤ 40 - 16t ≤ 32</p><p></p><p>Subtracting 40 from all parts of the inequality, we get:</p><p></p><p>-24 ≤ -16t ≤ -8</p><p></p><p>Dividing by -16 (and reversing the direction of the inequality), we get:</p><p></p><p>2/3 ≥ t ≥ 1/3</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the velocity of the ball will be between 16 and 32 feet per second when t is between 1/3 and 2/3 seconds.</p><p></p><p>4. Let n be the number of months that have passed.</p><p>For Option A, the monthly stipend is ₱4000.00, so the total stipend after n months is 4000n.</p><p></p><p>For Option B, the monthly stipend starts at ₱2500.00 and increases by ₱250.00 each month. Therefore, the monthly stipend after n months is:</p><p></p><p>2500 + 250(n-1) = 250n + 2250</p><p></p><p>Assuming that both students save exactly half of their total stipend, their monthly savings are:</p><p></p><p>Bea: 4000n/2 = 2000n</p><p></p><p>Pete: (250n + 2250)/2 = 125n + 1125</p><p></p><p>We want to find the value of n when Pete's monthly savings is greater than Bea's. Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:</p><p></p><p>125n + 1125 &gt; 2000n</p><p></p><p>Subtracting 125n from both sides, we get:</p><p></p><p>1125 &gt; 1875n</p><p></p><p>Dividing by 1875, we get:</p><p></p><p>n &lt; 0.6</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after 0.5 months (or 2 weeks and 3 days), Pete will have more monthly savings from their stipends</p><br />

Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of Reading
I have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.
He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.
It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.
I am this kid.
