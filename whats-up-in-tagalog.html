                                            favor to translate this in Tagalog but by thought and not word by word (like Google ). thank you! Indeed, how heartbreaking and devasting to only hear from the word "unemployment". But what more could it be when we learn further about it? What does "unemployment" really mean? Is it just the lack of one's source of living? Or is there more to it than just that? What are the news and articles pertaining to it trying to address? What are they trying to imply? What happens to those affected by this certain issue? The people, their families, status, lifestyle, their country? And oh, the economy. A lot of questions linger in our minds, leaving us a mark on what "unemployment" really is, and how far it can go and affect us. These questions, they add up and increase; yet, they remain unanswered. Thus, the making of this essay has a major goal of fulfilling the thoughts, untiringly lingering in our minds about the true essence of "unemployment", its aspects, effects, how to cope with it, and more.​</a>

                                            What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</a>

Personal development is closely linked to
self-awareness. It gives you the opportunity
to take an honest look at the areas of your
life that need improvement. Through this
process, you get to know who you really
are, what your true values are, and where
you would like to go in life. It is very important in order for us students
not to regret our decisions in life. We
should think thoroughly because we may
never know what will happen in the future.
Be mature enough and grow up to think
what you should want to be in the future.</a>

                            5. favor to translate this in Tagalog but by thought and not word by word (like Google ). thank you! Indeed, how heartbreaking and devasting to only hear from the word "unemployment". But what more could it be when we learn further about it? What does "unemployment" really mean? Is it just the lack of one's source of living? Or is there more to it than just that? What are the news and articles pertaining to it trying to address? What are they trying to imply? What happens to those affected by this certain issue? The people, their families, status, lifestyle, their country? And oh, the economy. A lot of questions linger in our minds, leaving us a mark on what "unemployment" really is, and how far it can go and affect us. These questions, they add up and increase; yet, they remain unanswered. Thus, the making of this essay has a major goal of fulfilling the thoughts, untiringly lingering in our minds about the true essence of "unemployment", its aspects, effects, how to cope with it, and more.​</h2><br />
                        <p>Tunay nga namang nakakadurog ng puso at nakakabagsik isipin na ang salitang "kawalan ng trabaho" lamang ang naririnig natin. Pero paano pa kaya kung mas lumalim pa tayo sa usapin tungkol dito? Ano ba talaga ang kahulugan ng "kawalan ng trabaho"? Tanging kakulangan ba ito ng kabuhayan ng isang tao, o mayroon pa itong ibang kahulugan kaysa roon? Ano ang mga balita at artikulo na may kinalaman dito at kung ano ang kanilang sinasabi? Ano ang kanilang mga ipinapahiwatig? Ano ang nangyayari sa mga taong naapektuhan ng isyung ito? Ang mga taong ito, ang kanilang mga pamilya, estado sa buhay, pamumuhay, kanilang bansa? At oo, ang ekonomiya.</p><p>Maraming mga katanungan ang umaagos sa ating mga isipan, na nag-iwan ng marka sa atin tungkol sa tunay na kahulugan ng "kawalan ng trabaho" at kung gaano kalayo ito maaring makaapekto sa atin. Ang mga katanungang ito, nagdagdag at nagparami, ngunit nananatiling walang sagot. Kaya't ang layunin ng sanaysay na ito ay upang tugunan ang mga kaisipan na patuloy na umaaligid sa ating isipan tungkol sa tunay na kahulugan ng "kawalan ng trabaho", ang mga aspeto nito, ang mga epekto nito, kung paano harapin ito, at higit pa.</p><p><strong>Answer: Is this a free verse poem, I think use Grammarly first since there are several grammatical errors in your essay or what.

Ngunit ano pa kaya ito kapag nalaman pa natin ang tungkol dito? Ano ba talaga ang ibig sabihin ng "kawalan ng trabaho"? Kulang na lang ba sa pinagkukunan ng buhay? O may higit pa rito kaysa iyon lamang? Ano ang sinusubukang tugunan ng mga balita at artikulong nauukol dito? Ano ang sinusubukan nilang ipahiwatig? Ano ang mangyayari sa mga apektado ng isyung ito? Ang mga tao, kanilang pamilya, katayuan, pamumuhay, kanilang bansa? At ang "ekonomiya"!<br /><br />Maraming katanungan ang nanatili sa ating isipan, na nag-iiwan sa atin ng marka kung ano nga ba ang "kawalan ng trabaho". Ang mga tanong na ito ay nagdaragdag lamang, ngunit nananatiling hindi sinasagot. Kaya, ang sanaysay na ito ay tutuparin ang bawat huling kaisipan, na walang pagod na tumatak sa ating isipan tungkol sa tunay na diwa ng kawalan ng trabaho, mga aspeto nito, mga epekto, kung paano ito haharapin, at higit pa.​</strong></p><p><br /><br /><br /><br /></p><br />

                            15. What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Height is just one of the thousands of features your genes decide. In fact, because you have two parents, your genes act like a referee, giving you a height that usually lands somewhere between the height of each parent. If both your parents are tall, then most likely you will be tall, too, but if you have questions about how tall you're going to be, ask your doctor if he or she can help you figure it out.</p><p></p><p>But genes don't decide everything. For example, eating an unhealthy diet can keep you from growing to your full potential. Getting plenty of sleep, enough exercise, and nutrients will help you grow just like you should.</p><p></p><p>No doubt you're wondering how fast you should grow. It depends. There's no perfect or right amount. On average, kids grow about 2 inches (6 centimeters) a year between age 3 and when they start puberty (when your body starts changing and becoming more grown up).</p><p></p><p>Your doctor will know how your growth has been going over the years. Two centimeters here and 2 inches there are not nearly as important as the height you're at now, how you've been growing up to this point, and what other changes your body may be going through.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Personal development is closely linked to
self-awareness. It gives you the opportunity
to take an honest look at the areas of your
life that need improvement. Through this
process, you get to know who you really
are, what your true values are, and where
you would like to go in life. It is very important in order for us students
not to regret our decisions in life. We
should think thoroughly because we may
never know what will happen in the future.
Be mature enough and grow up to think
what you should want to be in the future.</h2><br />
