Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</a>

Guide QuestionsWhat do you notice with the flow of lines being formed?Which melody has a wider movement of music notes and which one has a closer note movement?On a wider scale, National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA’s) Felipe M. De Leon, in his article about the Diversity of Philippine Music Cultures mentioned some contrasting features of Ilocanos’ and the Visayans’ art forms. Ilocanos prefer the movement of their music to be closer (conjunct) while the Visayans like it farther (disjunct). Ilocano dances have inward hand and arms movement while the Visayans have outward gestures. These intriguing polar artistic characteristics of the two subcultures may have rooted from their own natural values, the Ilocanos’ reserve attitude and the Visayans’ being highly-spirited; the Ilocanos’ survival instinct and the Visayans’ jubilant nature.

Your score is The People of the Philippines by the Philippine Tourism Promotions Board (1) Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 70 million, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders evolved the people of a unique blend of east and west, both in appearance and culture, The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for are said to be taken from Malay forefathers. (2) The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16 century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one. (3) Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions. Each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayas from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. (4) Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 11l dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups Some 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain's lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and these people can be found basically in Mindanao. (5) The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christian demonstrations and Buddhist.​</a>

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</h2><br />

Guide QuestionsWhat do you notice with the flow of lines being formed?Which melody has a wider movement of music notes and which one has a closer note movement?On a wider scale, National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA’s) Felipe M. De Leon, in his article about the Diversity of Philippine Music Cultures mentioned some contrasting features of Ilocanos’ and the Visayans’ art forms. Ilocanos prefer the movement of their music to be closer (conjunct) while the Visayans like it farther (disjunct). Ilocano dances have inward hand and arms movement while the Visayans have outward gestures. These intriguing polar artistic characteristics of the two subcultures may have rooted from their own natural values, the Ilocanos’ reserve attitude and the Visayans’ being highly-spirited; the Ilocanos’ survival instinct and the Visayans’ jubilant nature. TRANSFERAfter listening to the audio sample provided, try to answer the following questions. 1. What do you notice about the melody? What instrument played it? 2. How about the mood of the pieces? How can you say that it shows a happy mood, a sad mood, a relax mood, a playful mood, a patriotic mood? 3. Suppose all the instruments will only play the melody of the piece, what do you think will be your general impression about the piece? 4. How does the dynamics of the piece affect its overall sound? Which is better, a piece with dynamics or without dynamics? Why? 5. If ever you will choose your rondalla instrument, what will it be? Why? 6.

Your score is The People of the Philippines by the Philippine Tourism Promotions Board (1) Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 70 million, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders evolved the people of a unique blend of east and west, both in appearance and culture, The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for are said to be taken from Malay forefathers. (2) The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16 century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one. (3) Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions. Each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayas from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. (4) Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 11l dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups Some 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain's lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and these people can be found basically in Mindanao. (5) The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christian demonstrations and Buddhist.​</h2><br />

                            20. 1 ,Why did Emilio Aguinaldo donate his house to the Philippine government?
2,What is the purpose of the topmost level of Aguinaldo’s house and how did this help them against the Spaniards?
3,We all know that the Aguinaldo Shrine was a witness in the declaration of the Philippine Independence on June 12, 1898 simultaneous with the waving of the first Philippine Flag and singing of the National Anthem, Marcha Nacional Filipina (Spanish) or Lupang Hinirang in Tagalog. Suppose that you witnessed that moment, what will be your feelings and will you be proud of what is happening? Why or why not?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Emilio Aguinaldo donated his house, which is now known as the Aguinaldo Shrine, to the Philippine government to serve as a symbol of his patriotism and his contribution to the country's struggle for independence. He wanted the house to become a national shrine that would remind Filipinos of their hard-won freedom and inspire them to uphold the values of liberty, democracy, and national sovereignty.</p><p></p><p>The topmost level of Aguinaldo's house served as a watchtower that allowed the Philippine revolutionary forces to monitor the movements of the Spanish troops in the surrounding areas. From this vantage point, the revolutionaries could detect any imminent threat and prepare their defenses accordingly. This helped them to mount a successful defense against the Spanish attack during the Battle of Alapan on May 28, 1898, which ultimately led to the hoisting of the Philippine flag.</p><p></p><p>If I witnessed the declaration of Philippine independence on June 12, 1898, I would feel overwhelmed with emotions of pride and joy. Witnessing the historic moment of a nation's birth and the culmination of a long and arduous struggle for independence would be a powerful experience. As an AI language model, I don't have feelings, but I can understand the significance of the event and appreciate the sacrifices made by the Filipinos who fought for their freedom. The declaration of independence represents the triumph of the human spirit over oppression and tyranny, and it is a reminder of the power of collective action in achieving a noble goal.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

Answer the following questions:
1. What message does the lyricist, Levi Celerio, convey in his song?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>ctto:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>the famous filipino folk song "ang pipit" has a sad story. if we will try to interpet the lyrics literally, it talks about a bird who was hit by a stone. the poor creature was unable to fly because of the pain and the severity of the injury so it fell from the tree. but before it hit the ground, it expresses its worry that another bird will be sad by the former's demise and that the man was too cruel for taking an innocent living being's life.
