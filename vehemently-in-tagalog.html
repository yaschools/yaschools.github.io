Art thou that Beowulf with Breca did struggle,
On the wide sea-currents at swimming contended,
Where to humor your pride the ocean ye tried,
’Twas mere folly that actuated you both to risk your lives on the ocean. 
From vainest vaunting adventured your bodies
In care of the waters?
...
In the water’s possession,
Ye toiled for a seven-night; he at swimming outdid thee,
In strength excelled thee.
...
The pledge that he made thee
Breca outdid you entirely. 
The son of Beanstan hath soothly accomplished.
Then I ween thou wilt find thee less fortunate issue,
Much more will Grendel outdo you, if you vie with him in prowess. 
Which of these words best describes Unferth's tone?
 A. vehement
 B. insulting
 C. ironic
 D. casual</a>

                                            POWER IN POWERLESSNESS The late former President Cory Aquino and her son Noynoy, at their Times Street residence in February 2006, heatedly debated her resolve to intercede during the Marine standoff at the then Fort Bonifacio. Noynoy, on whose lap fell the responsibility of looking after his mother after his father Ninoy was assassinated, was determined to keep her out of the fray, especially then when she was no longer president. Cory, however, remained obstinate as she unequivocally expressed her determination to proceed to Fort Bonifactio. Noynoy vehemently tried to dissuade her, citing grave danger and the volatility of the situation there. Furthermore, he wamed that those inside Fort Bonifacio were not exactly friendly forces and those outside were no less hostile than those besieged. But Cory stuck to her guns and declared, "Everything is simple. My duty is to avert bloodshed at all cost. Help me." Thus, Cory the ex-Commander-in-Chief prevailed upon Noynoy to escort her to Fort Bonifacio. Thre, the combatants seethed with anger. Calmly, Cory wedged herself between protagonists, pulled out her story, and began to pray. Before long, the simmering confrontation was miraculously defused. Cory Aquino, who fearlessly staked her life to effect peaceful change serenely rested on the power of the Almighty, truly realizing her own powerlessness. 1) Why was Cory insistent on Noynoy's accompanying her to Fort Bonifacio Why was Noynoy opposed to his mother's plea for him to bring her to Fort Bonifacio? 2) What was Cory's reason for intervening in the fray? 3) What kind of "armament" did she use to put her conviction to action? 4) What character trait/s did she reveal in this incident?5) Is the title appropriate for the model paragraph? Explain your answer. 6) What is the setting? 7) Who are the characters? 8) Whose person is characterized? 9) What is the writer's point of view used?​</a>

                                            BALAI Chairman Timmy Mondiguing against city's tree - cutting moratorium plan redevelopment. A local civic leader is vehemently against the city government's plans to impose a moratorium on tree- cutting activities in the Summer Capital especially when pine trees are displaced by building constructions. Timmy Apilis Mondiguing, cited a news report where DENR Cordillera director Ralph Pablo recently suggested to the city council dinance could and these activities for Mayor Benjamin Magalong had proposed to Malacanang so he could dertake "I strongly disagree with this plan. What our officials need to do instead is to immediately declare a moratorium on issuances of titles for lands covered by tax declarations" Mondiguing stressed He explained that when innocent owners buy land in a commercial area or in a subdivision they did not buy these lands with their hard- earned money only to be turned into a water reserve, forest or for regreening purposes by the local government. These owners buy land either for residential purposes or to build commercial structures that will provide much need jobs and revenue to bolster the city's coffers," Mondiguing said. Although he fully supports the move of local officials in their aspirations to develop Mondiguing believes that Baguio, this should be done without violating the rights of innocent owners on how they will use their acquired land as long as their actions are within the purview of the law                           use dis in tree sentence​</a>

                                            Read the following situations and write an informal proposal for the stated problem. When writing the report, decide on the additional information you may want to include in your proposal.  San Jose College (SJC) is under company rehabilitation which means that the school is in the brink of bankruptcy. During the rehabilitation, SJC is under the supervision of a judicial court through a three- member management committee. Take the role of the management committee of the school in this scenario. Currently, the only source of income for the operations of the school is the fees of the students. Despite the disheartening plight of the school, the teachers demanded at least a 12% increase in salary. They said that any amount less than that will be unacceptable and will drive them to resign en masse. The action of the teachers seemed understandable because they have not received any salary increase in the last three years. You decided to increase the tuition fee of the students but the parents and student leaders vehemently objected to the increase. They threatened that if the tuition fee will be increased, the parents will pull out their children from the school. You have set a meeting with both parties but it failed. Both parties refused to meet halfway. How would you solve the problem?Use the following information in proposing a sound solution:The school has 25 teachers with an average monthly salary of P20, 000. 00. Ten (10) teach at the elementary and high school level and the other 15 teach the tertiary level. The school has around 200 students; 100 enrolled in the basic education and another 100 at the tertiary level. Tuition and other fees of each student total P30, 000 per year for basic education and P22, 000 per semester for tertiary education. Computers are obsolete. The school has three janitors. Each classroom can accommodate 30 students. As provided in the manual for private schools, the breakdown of a school budget for its operations is listed as follows: 70% for teachers’ salary; 20% for operating expenses (15% for the non-teaching personnel’s salary and 5% for the bills, etc.); and 10%for profit. However, since the school is in the brink of bankruptcy, it doesn’t get any profit at all. Thus, all expenses are allocated for the teacher’s salary and operating expenses with a ratio of 75:25, respectively. Further, you can only save roughly 5% from the bills and equipment expenditures.Now, your aim as part of the management committee is to address the concerns of both the students and the teachers. You also need to make at least 10% profit from the solutions that you will formulate in order for the school to survive in the next five years. Be sure that your solutions are ethical and lawful.​</a>

                            4. Read this excerpt from Beowulf, in which Unferth, one of Hrothgar's warriors, addresses Beowulf. 
Art thou that Beowulf with Breca did struggle,
On the wide sea-currents at swimming contended,
Where to humor your pride the ocean ye tried,
’Twas mere folly that actuated you both to risk your lives on the ocean. 
From vainest vaunting adventured your bodies
In care of the waters?
...
In the water’s possession,
Ye toiled for a seven-night; he at swimming outdid thee,
In strength excelled thee.
...
The pledge that he made thee
Breca outdid you entirely. 
The son of Beanstan hath soothly accomplished.
Then I ween thou wilt find thee less fortunate issue,
Much more will Grendel outdo you, if you vie with him in prowess. 
Which of these words best describes Unferth's tone?
 A. vehement
 B. insulting
 C. ironic
 D. casual</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>B. insulting</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The answer is B. insulting</p><p>Unferth is addressing Beowulf in a disdainful, mocking, and insulting manner. He is taunting Beowulf by reminding him of his previous defeat in a swimming contest with his friend Breca and questioning his abilities to defeat Grendel. He is also showing his skepticism toward Beowulf's strength and bravery. He is not being ironic, casual, or even vehement.</p><p>B. Insulting.</p><p></p><p>In this excerpt, Unferth addresses Beowulf with a tone that is clearly intended to belittle and demean him. He uses words such as <strong>"folly," "vainest vaunting," and "less fortunate issue" </strong>to suggest that Beowulf's actions are foolish and that he is unlikely to be successful in his upcoming battle with Grendel. Additionally, Unferth implies that Beowulf is weaker and less skilled than Breca, another warrior, and suggests that Beowulf will be outdone by Grendel, further diminishing Beowulf's status and reputation. Overall, Unferth's tone is one of condescension and disrespect, making it clear that he views Beowulf as inferior and unworthy of respect.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>This past week has seen the attention of all major news websites and networks focus on a man who has just died. While many around the globe have been reading his obituary, and as I write this heads of state from around the world are traveling to attend his funeral, few are making the connection between this man’s life, and the final words of another man who made some sweeping pronouncements about 3500 years ago – who was about to die. From the perspective of deep history, the impact of the man’s life that has just passed, though resonating so powerfully around the world right now, can be seen as just one wave in a much stronger and deeper current that was unleashed by this other man who lived so long ago.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The man in question who just passed away is Ariel Sharon, the former Prime Minister of Israel and, according to many of these news outlets, was one of the fiercest and most brilliant military leaders in our generation. Reading through some of his military exploits sounds like the toughness of Rambo, the cunning of James Bond, and the ruthlessness of Genghis Khan – all rolled into one. But his bold political moves – sometimes towards confrontation and sometimes to peace – were equally as influential as his military exploits.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Though I have found these obituaries interesting reading, it is in the context of the last words of the earlier man – Moses – that the reading of the career of Ariel Sharon shifts gears to make me feel wonder, fascination, and even a little somewhat ‘eerie’. So permit me to unpack a part of the Bible seldom read so that you too can consider the impact of Moses’s parting words through lives like that of Ariel Sharon.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            21. POWER IN POWERLESSNESS The late former President Cory Aquino and her son Noynoy, at their Times Street residence in February 2006, heatedly debated her resolve to intercede during the Marine standoff at the then Fort Bonifacio. Noynoy, on whose lap fell the responsibility of looking after his mother after his father Ninoy was assassinated, was determined to keep her out of the fray, especially then when she was no longer president. Cory, however, remained obstinate as she unequivocally expressed her determination to proceed to Fort Bonifactio. Noynoy vehemently tried to dissuade her, citing grave danger and the volatility of the situation there. Furthermore, he wamed that those inside Fort Bonifacio were not exactly friendly forces and those outside were no less hostile than those besieged. But Cory stuck to her guns and declared, "Everything is simple. My duty is to avert bloodshed at all cost. Help me." Thus, Cory the ex-Commander-in-Chief prevailed upon Noynoy to escort her to Fort Bonifacio. Thre, the combatants seethed with anger. Calmly, Cory wedged herself between protagonists, pulled out her story, and began to pray. Before long, the simmering confrontation was miraculously defused. Cory Aquino, who fearlessly staked her life to effect peaceful change serenely rested on the power of the Almighty, truly realizing her own powerlessness. 1) Why was Cory insistent on Noynoy's accompanying her to Fort Bonifacio Why was Noynoy opposed to his mother's plea for him to bring her to Fort Bonifacio? 2) What was Cory's reason for intervening in the fray? 3) What kind of "armament" did she use to put her conviction to action? 4) What character trait/s did she reveal in this incident?5) Is the title appropriate for the model paragraph?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Cory wanted Noynoy to accompany her to Fort Bonifacio to avert bloodshed.
