                                            translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</a>

                                            People and ReligionDepartment of Tourism1The Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish, and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million 
as of May 2000, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. 
From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in 
appearance and culture.2The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one.3The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.4The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.5Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.6The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia. Today, it is limited to the southern region of the country.9Christianity was introduced as early as the 16th century with the coming of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.10Protestantism was introduced by the first Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who arrived with the American soldiers in 1899.11Two Filipino independent churches were organized at the turn of the century and are prominent today. These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.

                            5. translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</h2><br />

                            11. People and ReligionDepartment of Tourism1The Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish, and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million 
as of May 2000, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. 
From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in 
appearance and culture.2The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one.3The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.4The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.5Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.6The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia. Today, it is limited to the southern region of the country.9Christianity was introduced as early as the 16th century with the coming of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.10Protestantism was introduced by the first Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who arrived with the American soldiers in 1899.11Two Filipino independent churches were organized at the turn of the century and are prominent today. These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.
