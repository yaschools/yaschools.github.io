Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.
 Performers: Students of De La Salle College of St. Benilde
 Zildjian Benitez (vocals); Tim Marquez (guitarist);
 Diana Mapa (percussions)
 Date performed: April 3, 2016

(Tagalog)
Panganay na anak ni Haring Saul si Jonathan. Isa siyang matapang na mandirigma. Sinabi ni David na mas mabilis pa si Jonathan kaysa sa agila at mas malakas pa kaysa sa leon. Dahil si Jonathan ang panganay na anak ni Saul, siya dapat ang susunod na magiging hari ng Israel. Subalit batid niya na si David ang pinili ni Diyos na susunod na magiging hari. Imbes na mainggit, naging matalik na magkaibigan sina Jonathan at David. Nangako silang poprotektahan at ipagtatanggol nila ang isa’t isa. Ibinigay ni Jonathan kay David ang kaniyang damit, espada, pana, at sinturon bilang tanda o simbolo ng kanilang pagkakaibigan. Noong panahong tumatakas si David kay Saul, pinuntahan siya ni Jonathan at sinabing: ‘Huwag kang matakot. Ikaw ang pinili ni Diyos na maging hari, at batid ’yan ng aking ama.’ Ilang beses ding nanganib ang buhay ni Jonathan dahil sa pagtulong sa kanyang kaibigang si David. Alam niyang gustong patayin ni Haring Saul ang kanyang kaibigan, kaya kinausap niya ang kaniyang ama at sinabi: ‘Magkakasala ka kapag pinatay mo si David; wala naman siyang kasalanan sa iyo.’ Si Haring Saul ay nagalit kay Jonathan. Makalipas ang ilang taon, magkasamang namatay sa digmaan sina Haring Saul at Jonathan. Pumalit sa puwesto ng pagiging hari si David. Hinanap ni Haring David ang anak ni Jonathan na si Mepiboset. Nang magkita sila, sinabi ni David kay Mepiboset: ‘Matalik kong kaibigan ang iyong ama, kaya hindi kita pababayaan. Maninirahan ka sa palasyo ko at kakain sa mesa ko.’ Hindi nalimutan ni Haring David ang kanyag kaibigan at pinagpatuloy ang naging pangako kay Jonathan sa pamamagitan ng kanyang naging anak.
(English)
King Saul's eldest son Jonathan. He was a brave warrior. David said that Jonathan was even faster than the eagle and even stronger than the lion. Since Jonathan was Saul's firstborn son, he was to be the next king of Israel. But he knew that God had chosen David to be the next king. Instead of being jealous, Jonathan and David became close friends. They promised to protect and defend each other. Jonathan gave David his garment, sword, bow, and belt as a sign or symbol of their friendship. When David is fleeing from Saul, Jonathan comes to him and says: 'Do not be afraid. You are the one God has chosen to be king, and my father knows that. ’Jonathan’s life was also in danger several times for helping his friend David. He knew that King Saul wanted to kill his friend, so he spoke to his father and said: ‘You will sin if you kill David; he has not sinned against you. ’King Saul was angry with Jonathan. Some years later, King Saul and Jonathan died together in battle. David succeeds him as king. King David sought out Jonathan's son Mephibosheth. When they meet, David tells Mephibosheth: 'Your father is a close friend of mine, so I will not leave you. You will live in my palace and eat at my table. ’King David did not forget his handsome friend and continued the promise made to Jonathan through his son.

De laCosta's Rizal emerges as an outstanding moral figure whose devotion to the truth made his novels a sourceof moral as well as social and political wisdom for Filipinos. Although subsequent drafts show he was forcedby an unknown interlocutor to temper this view, he retained an essentially positive reading of the novels. Inthe face of Recto's 1956 bill imposing the novels, however, Archbishop (Abp.) Rufino J. Santoscommissioned Father (Fr.) Jesus Cavanna to draft a new "Statement." Beginning with a few positiveparagraphs from De la Costa, the "Statement" then absolutely condemned the novels and forbade theirreading, a prohibition that proved quite ineffective. The drafts of De la Costa show that there was within theCatholic Church a totally different attitude toward Rizal, whose legacy the church could embrace.paki explain to ng tagalog :( thank you!</a>

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

Answer the following questions:
1. What message does the lyricist, Levi Celerio, convey in his song?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>ctto:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>the famous filipino folk song "ang pipit" has a sad story. if we will try to interpet the lyrics literally, it talks about a bird who was hit by a stone. the poor creature was unable to fly because of the pain and the severity of the injury so it fell from the tree. but before it hit the ground, it expresses its worry that another bird will be sad by the former's demise and that the man was too cruel for taking an innocent living being's life.

(Tagalog)
Panganay na anak ni Haring Saul si Jonathan. Isa siyang matapang na mandirigma. Sinabi ni David na mas mabilis pa si Jonathan kaysa sa agila at mas malakas pa kaysa sa leon. Dahil si Jonathan ang panganay na anak ni Saul, siya dapat ang susunod na magiging hari ng Israel. Subalit batid niya na si David ang pinili ni Diyos na susunod na magiging hari. Imbes na mainggit, naging matalik na magkaibigan sina Jonathan at David. Nangako silang poprotektahan at ipagtatanggol nila ang isa’t isa. Ibinigay ni Jonathan kay David ang kaniyang damit, espada, pana, at sinturon bilang tanda o simbolo ng kanilang pagkakaibigan. Noong panahong tumatakas si David kay Saul, pinuntahan siya ni Jonathan at sinabing: ‘Huwag kang matakot. Ikaw ang pinili ni Diyos na maging hari, at batid ’yan ng aking ama.’ Ilang beses ding nanganib ang buhay ni Jonathan dahil sa pagtulong sa kanyang kaibigang si David. Alam niyang gustong patayin ni Haring Saul ang kanyang kaibigan, kaya kinausap niya ang kaniyang ama at sinabi: ‘Magkakasala ka kapag pinatay mo si David; wala naman siyang kasalanan sa iyo.’ Si Haring Saul ay nagalit kay Jonathan. Makalipas ang ilang taon, magkasamang namatay sa digmaan sina Haring Saul at Jonathan. Pumalit sa puwesto ng pagiging hari si David. Hinanap ni Haring David ang anak ni Jonathan na si Mepiboset. Nang magkita sila, sinabi ni David kay Mepiboset: ‘Matalik kong kaibigan ang iyong ama, kaya hindi kita pababayaan. Maninirahan ka sa palasyo ko at kakain sa mesa ko.’ Hindi nalimutan ni Haring David ang kanyag kaibigan at pinagpatuloy ang naging pangako kay Jonathan sa pamamagitan ng kanyang naging anak.
(English)
King Saul's eldest son Jonathan. He was a brave warrior. David said that Jonathan was even faster than the eagle and even stronger than the lion. Since Jonathan was Saul's firstborn son, he was to be the next king of Israel. But he knew that God had chosen David to be the next king. Instead of being jealous, Jonathan and David became close friends. They promised to protect and defend each other. Jonathan gave David his garment, sword, bow, and belt as a sign or symbol of their friendship. When David is fleeing from Saul, Jonathan comes to him and says: 'Do not be afraid. You are the one God has chosen to be king, and my father knows that. ’Jonathan’s life was also in danger several times for helping his friend David. He knew that King Saul wanted to kill his friend, so he spoke to his father and said: ‘You will sin if you kill David; he has not sinned against you. ’King Saul was angry with Jonathan. Some years later, King Saul and Jonathan died together in battle. David succeeds him as king. King David sought out Jonathan's son Mephibosheth. When they meet, David tells Mephibosheth: 'Your father is a close friend of mine, so I will not leave you. You will live in my palace and eat at my table. ’King David did not forget his handsome friend and continued the promise made to Jonathan through his son.

                            22. paki explain to ng tagalog tungkol sa RIZAL BILL 1956: HORACIO DE LA COSTA AND THE BISHOPS.Several drafts of a pastoral letter, written by Horacio de la Costa for the bishops in 1952, survive. De laCosta's Rizal emerges as an outstanding moral figure whose devotion to the truth made his novels a sourceof moral as well as social and political wisdom for Filipinos. Although subsequent drafts show he was forcedby an unknown interlocutor to temper this view, he retained an essentially positive reading of the novels. Inthe face of Recto's 1956 bill imposing the novels, however, Archbishop (Abp.) Rufino J. Santoscommissioned Father (Fr.) Jesus Cavanna to draft a new "Statement." Beginning with a few positiveparagraphs from De la Costa, the "Statement" then absolutely condemned the novels and forbade theirreading, a prohibition that proved quite ineffective.
