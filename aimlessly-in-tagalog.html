                                            Read the paragraph and answer the following questions.  There are a few places that can boast an act of creation everyday. A newspaper is one of them. Out of the daily newsroom whirl emerges a remarkable product. In a matter of hours, thousands of words and pictures are put together in a cohesive pattern designed to inform, enlighten, and entertain the reader. To a casual observer, the men and women working in the newsroom may appear to be running about aimlessly amid the clatter of typewriters and the continually ringing telephones. Actually, the scurrying around, the occasional shouting, the general air of excitement are all part of a controlled procedure. Each editor, reporter, and copyboy has a designated job, the end result of which is the newspaper that rolls off the press on time.  QUESTIONS: 1. The topic sentence in the paragraph is sentence number Answer .  2. The type of paragraph development: Answer  3. Give one signal word from the paragraph, indicating space, location and place.

He was called Edward,and everyone in the palace rejoiced and blessed the infant prince. That same day.another little boy was born to a very poor family. His name was Tom. His family was so poor that they rarely had enough money to buy food. Prince Edward had plenty offood and beautiful clothing. The king doted his only son and raised him in comfort andlove.Tom grew up in poverty and hunger and had to beg strangers for a bite to eat.His father was cruel and mean. Tom was upset one day and left home and wanderedthe streets aimlessly until he found himself before a magnificent palace. The guardsstopped him from entering the palace.Just then, Prince Edward was returning from a stroll when he heard the guard'sangry shouts. But being a good prince, he commanded the guards to let him enter thepalace. The prince gave Tom many good things to eat. The two boys exchangedclothes and they were amazed to see how much alike they looked.Dressed as a pauper, the Prince walked out of the palace as he wanted to seethe outside world. The guard frowned at him angrily. The guard threw the Prince outof the castle. Meanwhile, Tom's father, who had been searching for him through thestreets, saw the prince and rushed towards him. He ill-treated the prince like he alwaysdid. And in the palace, Tom was little better off. However much he tried to tell that hewas not Prince Edward, no one would listen. Even the servants didn't believe him.Tom had no choice but to continue his masquerade.The prince was beaten by Tom's father every day. The prince was afraid of himand no longer tried to argue. As he made his way through the village, the princethought about the things he had experienced. He wanted to punish Tom's father butno one at the palace would recognize Edward as the true prince. Edward continued togo from door to door, but no one in the village wanted to give him any food. Edwardkept wandering the village, but he couldn't even manage to get one meal a day.Several days went by like this.One day, Edward came upon a knight from a neighboring country whom he hadmeet before. Once, they had participated in an archery competition together. Grabbinghis chance, Edward reminded him of the details of their last meeting and tried toconvince him of his true identity. The knight agreed and promised to help him. Heseated the prince on his horse and they rode to the palace together. While all this washappening, the King died and everyone at the palace was focused on Tom'scoronation At that moment, Prince Edward burst into the throne room. Tom was confusedHe knew what his duty was, but he was afraid to go back to his former life as a pauperFinally, he made a decision and raised his voice above the din. He speaks the truthTom declared, "I am not Prince Edward, he is!" Tom had always been an honest anddecent boy. And so, Prince Edward was crowned king. He was deeply impressed withTom's honesty and loyalty. Tom became King Edward's favorite and he gave him thetitle as The King's WardPA HELP PO PLEASE PASAHAN NA PO KASI NAMIN MAMAYA​</a>

                                            A 76-year-old female client visits the clinic and tells the nurse about not feeling well for the last 2 weeks. The nurse observes that the client’s speech is slow; she has an unkempt appearance and maintains poor eye contact with the nurse. The nurse asks her to clarify what she means by not feeling well. The client states “I feel like I am losing my mind. Since my husband died a year ago, I can’t seem to remember anything. I lose my keys and wallet all the time. The other day, I even forgot how to get home from the supermarket. My neighbor saw me walking around aimlessly and came over to me. I was a block from home. I am getting worried that something may be wrong.” The nurse questions her further regarding her daily activities and learns that she lives alone and hardly goes out. Her son and daughter live out of state, and she doesn’t see them often, although they talk on the phone every week. The client’s medical and surgical history is negative for medical conditions or surgeries. She appears thin and frail. Her last visit for a medical exam was 3 years ago. 
Questions: 
a. Based on the information provided by the client and the nurse’s assessment, what further assessment should the nurse conduct? 
b. Based on the data from the interview and the physical and mental assessment, formulate a plan of care for this client.</a>

There are a few places that can boast an act of creation everyday. A newspaper is one of them. Out of the daily newsroom whirl emerges a remarkable product. In a matter of hours, thousands of words and pictures are put together in a cohesive pattern designed to inform, enlighten, and entertain the reader. To a casual observer, the men and women working in the newsroom may appear to be running about aimlessly amid the clatter of typewriters and the continually ringing telephones. Actually, the scurrying around, the occasional shouting, the general air of excitement are all part of a controlled procedure. Each editor, reporter, and copyboy has a designated job, the end result of which is the newspaper that rolls off the press on time.

These observable surroundings stimulate the person. <strong> So while searching for a way, the individual is then faced with</strong><strong> Behavioral Determinants </strong><strong>such as Expectations, Perceptions, Needs, Representations, and Environmental Variables. So in other words, an individual gains knowledge as he or she tries to figure out how to reach the cousin waiting at one side of the park.

                            13. STORYThe Prince and the PauperMark TwainOnce upon a time, a son was born to a king and queen. He was called Edward,and everyone in the palace rejoiced and blessed the infant prince. That same day.another little boy was born to a very poor family. His name was Tom. His family was so poor that they rarely had enough money to buy food. Prince Edward had plenty offood and beautiful clothing. The king doted his only son and raised him in comfort andlove.Tom grew up in poverty and hunger and had to beg strangers for a bite to eat.His father was cruel and mean. Tom was upset one day and left home and wanderedthe streets aimlessly until he found himself before a magnificent palace. The guardsstopped him from entering the palace.Just then, Prince Edward was returning from a stroll when he heard the guard'sangry shouts. But being a good prince, he commanded the guards to let him enter thepalace. The prince gave Tom many good things to eat. The two boys exchangedclothes and they were amazed to see how much alike they looked.Dressed as a pauper, the Prince walked out of the palace as he wanted to seethe outside world. The guard frowned at him angrily. The guard threw the Prince outof the castle. Meanwhile, Tom's father, who had been searching for him through thestreets, saw the prince and rushed towards him. He ill-treated the prince like he alwaysdid. And in the palace, Tom was little better off. However much he tried to tell that hewas not Prince Edward, no one would listen. Even the servants didn't believe him.Tom had no choice but to continue his masquerade.The prince was beaten by Tom's father every day. The prince was afraid of himand no longer tried to argue. As he made his way through the village, the princethought about the things he had experienced. He wanted to punish Tom's father butno one at the palace would recognize Edward as the true prince. Edward continued togo from door to door, but no one in the village wanted to give him any food. Edwardkept wandering the village, but he couldn't even manage to get one meal a day.Several days went by like this.One day, Edward came upon a knight from a neighboring country whom he hadmeet before. Once, they had participated in an archery competition together. Grabbinghis chance, Edward reminded him of the details of their last meeting and tried toconvince him of his true identity. The knight agreed and promised to help him. Heseated the prince on his horse and they rode to the palace together. While all this washappening, the King died and everyone at the palace was focused on Tom'scoronation At that moment, Prince Edward burst into the throne room. Tom was confusedHe knew what his duty was, but he was afraid to go back to his former life as a pauperFinally, he made a decision and raised his voice above the din. He speaks the truthTom declared, "I am not Prince Edward, he is!" Tom had always been an honest anddecent boy. And so, Prince Edward was crowned king. He was deeply impressed withTom's honesty and loyalty. Tom became King Edward's favorite and he gave him thetitle as The King's WardPA HELP PO PLEASE PASAHAN NA PO KASI NAMIN MAMAYA​</h2><br />

                            18. A 76-year-old female client visits the clinic and tells the nurse about not feeling well for the last 2 weeks. The nurse observes that the client’s speech is slow; she has an unkempt appearance and maintains poor eye contact with the nurse. The nurse asks her to clarify what she means by not feeling well. The client states “I feel like I am losing my mind. Since my husband died a year ago, I can’t seem to remember anything. I lose my keys and wallet all the time. The other day, I even forgot how to get home from the supermarket. My neighbor saw me walking around aimlessly and came over to me. I was a block from home. I am getting worried that something may be wrong.” The nurse questions her further regarding her daily activities and learns that she lives alone and hardly goes out. Her son and daughter live out of state, and she doesn’t see them often, although they talk on the phone every week. The client’s medical and surgical history is negative for medical conditions or surgeries. She appears thin and frail. Her last visit for a medical exam was 3 years ago. 
Questions: 
a. Based on the information provided by the client and the nurse’s assessment, what further assessment should the nurse conduct? 
b. Based on the data from the interview and the physical and mental assessment, formulate a plan of care for this client.</h2><br />

                            20. Read the paragraph and answer the following questions.
There are a few places that can boast an act of creation everyday. A newspaper is one of them. Out of the daily newsroom whirl emerges a remarkable product. In a matter of hours, thousands of words and pictures are put together in a cohesive pattern designed to inform, enlighten, and entertain the reader. To a casual observer, the men and women working in the newsroom may appear to be running about aimlessly amid the clatter of typewriters and the continually ringing telephones. Actually, the scurrying around, the occasional shouting, the general air of excitement are all part of a controlled procedure. Each editor, reporter, and copyboy has a designated job, the end result of which is the newspaper that rolls off the press on time.
