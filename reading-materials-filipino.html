(CMI Philippines, April 21, 2020) Afterwards label each paragraph according to the parts of a persuasive writing. Choose from the options given below. INTRODUCTION CALL TO ACTION 1. "Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines. EVIDENCE 2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 8. The FISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country it 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers. as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the FISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</a>

(CNN Philippines, April 21, 2020). Afterwards label each paragraph according to the parts of a persuasive writing. Choose from the options given below. INTRODUCTION   EVIDENCE   CALL TO ACTION 1. "Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 3. The PISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country is 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers, as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the PISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</a>

In pre-colonial times, the Philippines was a divided set of nations, islands and tribes being ruled by their own kings, chieftains, lakans, rajahs, datus and sultans. Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger empire outside of what is now the Philippines. Manila, for example, was once part of the Islamic Sultanate of Brunei, and the Sulu Archipelago was also part of the Hindu Majapahit. The advent of colonial rule in the islands marked the beginning of the Philippines as an entity, a collection of Southeast Asian countries united under Spanish Empire.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

The setting of the story is a small barrio in rural Philippines during the early 1900s. The physical environment is described as being comprised of mango trees, bamboo orchards and thatched-roof huts. The setting plays a crucial role in the story in that it is representative of the cultural and historical events that the narrator is relating.</p><p></p><p>2. The story mentions various examples of the material culture of the barrio, such as mango trees, bamboo orchards, and thatched-roof huts, as well as cultural elements, such as the taboo against drinking alcohol in the presence of elders and the collective responsibilities of the barrio residents. The influence of culture on the story is demonstrative of the shared values, beliefs, and norms between the people of the barrio, which shape the narrator’s experiences, and ultimately, the story’s message.</p><p></p><p>3. The historical event that plays a role in the story is the strict prohibition in the Philippines of the “import and sale of any foreign drink” (later clarified as alcoholic beverages). The significance of this event in the story is that it reinforces the idea that the barrio’s population is comprised of mild drinkers, further highlighting the cultural taboo against alcohol consumption in the presence of elders and the respect for its collective responsibility of the people.</p><br />

"Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines. EVIDENCE 2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 8. The FISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country it 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers. as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the FISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</h2><br />

(CNN Philippines, April 21, 2020). Afterwards label each paragraph according to the parts of a persuasive writing. Choose from the options given below. INTRODUCTION   EVIDENCE   CALL TO ACTION 1. "Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 3. The PISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country is 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers, as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the PISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</h2><br />
