                            1. who can tell me the longest story​(kahit tagalog)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time there lived a chief who liked to listen to stories. And he knew so many stories that sometimes he stopped the story-teller and finished the story himself. One day the chief sent his servants everywhere to find a good story-teller.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Our Chief will give many presents to the man who will tell him the longest story in the world and make him laugh."
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The servants shouted in the streets. Many people came to the chief and told him very long stories. They tried to make him laugh. But nobody could do that. The chief always said, "That is not the longest story and there is nothing to laugh at."
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once a boy came to the chief and said, "Oh, my Chief, let me try to tell you the longest story in the world and make you laugh."
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The chief said, "Well, sit down and begin your story!" The boy began.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Long, long ago there lived a man, Mogambo by name. He ate so much that no man could feed him full. The chief of that country heard about Mogambo and said, 'Bring him to me. I shall feed him full.' And he ordered his people to bring hundreds of thousands of pots of soup, meat and fruit. Hundreds of camels carried the pots on their backs. The camels stopped in front of the chief’s house. Many people came to see Mogambo's dinner.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then Mogambo came. The drummers began to drum. The musicians began to play. And the people sang songs. Mogambo made a bow to the chief and said to the people, 'Now look at me! Look at me! Look at me!' With these words Mogambo began to eat soup. And he ate. And he ate. And he ate. And he ate. And he ate.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Well, what then?" asked the chief, "He ate. And he ate. And what then?"
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Oh, my chief," answered the boy, "this is only the first pot and there were many thousands of pots! Wait a little. And he ate. And he ate. And he ate.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Evening came. The boy went on with his story. “And he ate. And he ate. And he ate. "
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At last the chief ordered him to stop till the next morning. In the morning the chief asked the boy to go on with his story.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Now what can you tell us about your Mogambo?" he asked.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Oh, my Chief, he not only ate, but drank too, so he drank and then he ate and he ate and he ate."
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The story-teller said louder and louder, "and he ate and he ate and he ate."
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The chief looked at the boy and began to laugh.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Well, my boy, your story is the longest in the world! Have a rest now! Stop!"
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And the young story-teller stopped his story, got many presents from the chief, climbed up on a camel and rode away with these words: "And he ate, and he ate, and he ate"

The story follows the adventures of a mysterious figure known as the "Wandering Jew" in 18th century Calcutta. The Wandering Jew is an old myth about a man who was cursed to wander the earth for eternity, and in this story, he is used as a metaphor for the exploitation of people from different backgrounds and cultures that took place during this time period. Through his journey, he encounters various characters who represent different aspects of life in Calcutta at that time, such as poverty, superstition, and religious intolerance. Ultimately, the Wandering Jew serves as an allegory for how people can be taken advantage of when they are seen as outsiders or "others".<strong> </strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the midst of this global pandemic, we are reflecting in real-time on how systems undergo large-scale transformation—how government, businesses, schools, cities, and communities adapt and make fundamental changes to existing ways of working. This issue of systems change and, more specifically, how education initiatives scale and spread, is a topic that we at the Center for Universal Education (CUE) have been exploring in our Real-time Scaling Labs over the past year. These scaling labs—action research projects led by CUE and undertaken in partnership with local institutions across five countries—are an effort to learn how effective education practices scale across communities and countries. Through learning from, documenting, and supporting the process of expanding and deepening the impact of education initiatives around the world, the labs aim to develop concrete, practical guidance on key drivers that contribute to large-scale transformative change in education.
</p><p>
</p><p>Prior to the spread of COVID-19, we had been reflecting with our partners on how difficult it is to change a system: Systems prefer the status quo and often require a crisis to transform. We are certainly watching this play out today—many countries have been slow to respond to the global pandemic despite significant data and advice from experts on what measures are needed—and have only leapt into action once the magnitude of the virus was apparent.
</p><p>
</p><p>As the world grapples with responding to the current crisis, we are struck that some of the same key principles we have been studying in the Real-time Scaling Labs might also be relevant in responding to this pandemic. These include:
</p><p>
</p><p>Iterative, adaptive learning. Flexibility and adaptive capacity are crucial at a time when events unfold rapidly, and households, communities, and leaders must constantly adjust to a new reality on a day-by-day basis. The situation has also brought to the forefront a deeper appreciation of the importance of reliable, high-quality, timely data for decisionmaking, while acknowledging the limitations of existing data in representing the true scope of a rapidly shifting crisis. At the same time, we are witnessing firsthand what behavioral science has long shown—that data alone are not always enough to spur change as attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors are deeply ingrained in people and institutions.
</p><p>
The COVID-19 crisis is already having and will continue to have devastating consequences for individuals and communities across the globe, which must not be underestimated. At the same time, the crisis also provides a critical opportunity for us to learn more about the essential principles underpinning large-scale transformative change, as is needed in many education systems around the world. The hope is that we can come out on the other side of this pandemic with more evidence and lessons learned about how to expand the impact of effective social interventions and introduce new ways of working within our education systems to provide quality learning opportunities to all. In future posts, we will share stories from our scaling lab partners from around the world on how they are innovatively coping during this crisis to ensure that millions of children continue to receive an education. this is the short story pumili kanalang ng section dyan</p><p><strong>Explanation:Ibigay mona sakin yung Brainliest :&gt;</strong></p><p></p><br />
