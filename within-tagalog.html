Main organ
Kalayaan (dated January 1896, published March 1896)[3][4]
Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</a>

                                            Please help me guys explain this in tagalog 1. The relation between individual and society is very close. Essentially, “society” is the regularities, customs and ground rules of antihuman behavior. These practices are tremendously important to know how humans act and interact with each other. Society does not exist independently without individual. 2. The individual lives and acts within society but society is nothing, in spite of the combination of individuals for cooperative effort. On the other hand, society exists to serve individuals not the other way around. Human life and society almost go together.

De laCosta's Rizal emerges as an outstanding moral figure whose devotion to the truth made his novels a sourceof moral as well as social and political wisdom for Filipinos. Although subsequent drafts show he was forcedby an unknown interlocutor to temper this view, he retained an essentially positive reading of the novels. Inthe face of Recto's 1956 bill imposing the novels, however, Archbishop (Abp.) Rufino J. Santoscommissioned Father (Fr.) Jesus Cavanna to draft a new "Statement." Beginning with a few positiveparagraphs from De la Costa, the "Statement" then absolutely condemned the novels and forbade theirreading, a prohibition that proved quite ineffective. The drafts of De la Costa show that there was within theCatholic Church a totally different attitude toward Rizal, whose legacy the church could embrace.paki explain to ng tagalog :( thank you!</a>

Nonetheless, the work was steady and she needed all of the money that she could get. To her delight, Kelly got an interview at a big office in Tandag City for a job that paid much more. The interview went very well and the bosses all but offered her a position. They said that she would fit the role well and they promised that they would call her back within two weeks. Kelly couldn't wait to quit her job. As soon as she got back she quit her work in the store. She spent the next two weeks bragging to her coworkers about her new high-paying job in Tandag City. Yet, two weeks passed and she received no phone call. When Kelly decided to follow up on her interview, she learned that the bosses had chosen a different candidate. Kelly was crushed.​</a>

                                            would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</a>

Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</h2><br />

Essentially, “society” is the regularities, customs and ground rules of antihuman behavior. These practices are tremendously important to know how humans act and interact with each other. Society does not exist independently without individual. 2. The individual lives and acts within society but society is nothing, in spite of the combination of individuals for cooperative effort. On the other hand, society exists to serve individuals not the other way around. Human life and society almost go together. The relationship between individual and society is ultimately one of the profound of all the problems of social philosophy.3. The ultimate goal of society is to promote good and happy life for its individuals. It creates conditions and opportunities for the all round development of individual personality. ​</h2><br />

De laCosta's Rizal emerges as an outstanding moral figure whose devotion to the truth made his novels a sourceof moral as well as social and political wisdom for Filipinos. Although subsequent drafts show he was forcedby an unknown interlocutor to temper this view, he retained an essentially positive reading of the novels. Inthe face of Recto's 1956 bill imposing the novels, however, Archbishop (Abp.) Rufino J. Santoscommissioned Father (Fr.) Jesus Cavanna to draft a new "Statement." Beginning with a few positiveparagraphs from De la Costa, the "Statement" then absolutely condemned the novels and forbade theirreading, a prohibition that proved quite ineffective. The drafts of De la Costa show that there was within theCatholic Church a totally different attitude toward Rizal, whose legacy the church could embrace.paki explain to ng tagalog :( thank you!</h2><br />

Nonetheless, the work was steady and she needed all of the money that she could get. To her delight, Kelly got an interview at a big office in Tandag City for a job that paid much more. The interview went very well and the bosses all but offered her a position. They said that she would fit the role well and they promised that they would call her back within two weeks. Kelly couldn't wait to quit her job. As soon as she got back she quit her work in the store. She spent the next two weeks bragging to her coworkers about her new high-paying job in Tandag City. Yet, two weeks passed and she received no phone call. When Kelly decided to follow up on her interview, she learned that the bosses had chosen a different candidate. Kelly was crushed.​</h2><br />

Gayunpaman, ang trabaho ay hindi nagbabago at kailangan niya ang lahat ng pera na makukuha niya. Sa kanyang tuwa, nagpa-interview si Kelly sa isang malaking opisina sa Tandag City para sa trabahong mas malaki ang sahod. Ang panayam ay naging napakahusay at ang mga amo ay nag-alok sa kanya ng isang posisyon. Babagay daw siya sa role at nangako silang tatawagan siya ulit within two weeks. Hindi na makapaghintay si Kelly na huminto sa kanyang trabaho. Pagbalik niya ay huminto siya sa kanyang trabaho sa tindahan. Ginugol niya ang sumunod na dalawang linggo sa pagyayabang sa kanyang mga katrabaho tungkol sa kanyang bagong trabahong may mataas na suweldo sa Tandag City. Gayunpaman, lumipas ang dalawang linggo at wala siyang natanggap na tawag sa telepono. Nang magpasya si Kelly na i-follow up ang kanyang panayam, nalaman niyang ibang kandidato ang pinili ng mga boss.

                            27. would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</h2><br />
