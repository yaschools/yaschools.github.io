                                            Learning Task 4: Read this selection and note the details by answering the questions below. Write your answers in your notebook. Uwang and Salagubang “Uwang” (Rhinoceros Beetle in English) is one of the few beetles called by name in the Philippines. Other beetles are referred to as “salagubang”, the generic Tagalog word for beetle. Although we can see various pictures of Rhinoceros Beetle online, nothing can compare to seeing one up close and personal. From experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it’s really impossible to get it off easily. The variety found in the Philippines is the Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle. They may seem formidable and vicious, but appearance can be deceiving. They have sharp claws and those claws can only hurt you if you get pinched by them. Other than that, they are practically harmless. They also have horns and there is a difference in length depending on whether it’s a male or female. From what I understand, it’s the strongest insect in the world. I’m not willing to test the assertion. 1. What are the names of the two types of beetles which are found in the Philippines? 2. What variety of beetles do those two types come from? 3. How did the author describe the claws of “uwang” and “salagubang” ?4. Do you think you will be hurt once you see an “uwang” or “salagubang?” 5. What do you think is the purpose of the selection? Pls help ​</a>

The fallacy of accident begins with the statement of some principle that is true as a general rule, but then errs by applying this principle to a specific case that is unusual or atypical in some way.
•	Women earn less than men earn for doing the same work. 
•	Oprah Winfrey is a woman. 
•	Therefore, Oprah Winfrey earns less than male talk-show hosts.
As we'll soon see, a true universal premise would entail the truth of this conclusion; but then, a universal statement that "Every woman earns less than any man." would obviously be false. The truth of a general rule, on the other hand, leaves plenty of room for exceptional cases, and applying it to any of them is fallacious."</a>

Because by its language one can judge A town, a barrio, and kingdom; And like any other created thing Every human being loves his freedom. One who doesn't love his native tongue, Is worse than putrid fish and beast; And like a truly precious thing It therefore deserves to be cherished.

                                            What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</a>

Uwang and Salagubang “Uwang” (Rhinoceros Beetle in English) is one of the few beetles called by name in the Philippines. Other beetles are referred to as “salagubang”, the generic Tagalog word for beetle. Although we can see various pictures of Rhinoceros Beetle online, nothing can compare to seeing one up close and personal. From experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it’s really impossible to get it off easily. The variety found in the Philippines is the Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle. They may seem formidable and vicious, but appearance can be deceiving. They have sharp claws and those claws can only hurt you if you get pinched by them. Other than that, they are practically harmless. They also have horns and there is a difference in length depending on whether it’s a male or female. From what I understand, it’s the strongest insect in the world. I’m not willing to test the assertion. 1. What are the names of the two types of beetles which are found in the Philippines? 2.

                        Tandaan na hindi mo pipiliin, pinipili ka ng pag-ibig. Lahat na maaari mong gawin ay tanggapin ito para sa lahat ng misteryo nito pagdating sa iyong buhay. Huwag mag-alala kung pinupuno ka sa pag-apaw. Pagkatapos ay umabot ka at ibalik ito. Ibigay ito pabalik sa taong nagdala nito sa iyo. Ibigay mo ito sa iba na mahihirap sa espiritu. Ibigay mo ito sa mundo sa paligid mo sa anumang paraan na maaari mong. Ito ay kung saan maraming mga nagmamahal ay nagkamali. Matagal na walang pagmamahal, nauunawaan nila ang pag-ibig tanging bilang isang pangangailangan. Nakita niya ang kanilang mga puso bilang walang laman na mga lugar na mapupuno ng pagmamahal, at nagsisimula silang magmukhang isang bagay, na dumadaloy sa kanila sa halip na para sa kanila. Ang unang pamumula ng pagmamahal ay napuno sa pag-aapoy, ngunit habang ang kanilang pag-ibig ay cools , nagbabalik sila sa pagtingin, ang kanilang pag-ibig bilang pangangailangan. Tiyak na maging isang taong gumagawa ng pag-ibig at sa halip ay maging isang taong naghahanap ng pag-ibig. Nakalimutan nila na ang lihim ng loveis, na ito ay isang regalo, na maaari itong gawin upang lumago lamang sa pamamagitan ng pagbibigay nito.<br />

The fallacy of accident begins with the statement of some principle that is true as a general rule, but then errs by applying this principle to a specific case that is unusual or atypical in some way.

•	Oprah Winfrey is a woman. 
•	Therefore, Oprah Winfrey earns less than male talk-show hosts.
As we'll soon see, a true universal premise would entail the truth of this conclusion; but then, a universal statement that "Every woman earns less than any man." would obviously be false.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Jose Rizal's poem "<strong>Our Mother Tongue</strong>" makes use of various literary influences, including <strong>Romanticism and Nationalism</strong>. <strong>Romanticism</strong> is evident in the poem's emotional tone and imagery, as well as in its emphasis on individual experience and feeling. <strong>Nationalism</strong> is also a major influence in the poem, as Rizal seeks to promote a sense of national identity and pride among the Filipino people. Rizal also draws on the traditions of oral poetry and folklore in his use of repetition, rhythm, and metaphor, highlighting the potential of the Filipino language as a powerful tool for artistic expression and cultural resistance. His use of Romantic and Nationalist themes, along with his incorporation of traditional Filipino literary techniques, make the poem a powerful and evocative expression of Filipino identity and pride.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The uwang (in English, the Rhinoceros Beetle) is one of the few beetles called by name in the Philippines. Other beetles are referred to as salagubang, the generic Tagalog word for beetle.
</p><p>
</p><p>Although you can find various pictures online of the Rhinoceros Beetle, nothing can compare to seeing one up close and personal. From experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it's nearly impossible to get it off without killing it. The variety found in the Philippines is the Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle.
</p><p>
</p><p>They may seem formidable and vicious, but appearances can be deceiving. They have sharp claws, and those claws can only hurt you if you get pinched by them. Other than that, they're practically harmless. They also have horns, and there is a difference in length depending on whether it's male or female.
</p><p>
</p><p>From what I understand, it's the strongest insect in the world. I'm not willing to test that assertion.
</p><p>
</p><p>Beetles of All Kinds
</p><p>There are beetles in the Philippines that I've never seen anywhere else in the world, and I'd be lying if I told you I could name any of them. There are also beetles in the Philippines who could be considered "undocumented immigrants" from the United States, hitching rides on cargo ships and airplanes. Of course, I'm sure they come from other places as well, like Korea, Japan and China.
</p><p>
</p><p>Interestingly, a bilas of mine (a sister-in-law's husband) has a sister who was given the nickname of "Ubang" when she was young, which is short for salagubang. It took me a while to figure out it was because she was afraid of beetles when she was young, not because she looks like one (she doesn't, of course).
</p><p>
</p><p>Beetle Pest Control
</p><p>There really isn't any way to control these little creatures without causing environmental damage. They won't normally go where people go unless they're seeking a new food source (certain plants and trees). They usually only get into houses when people leave their doors open. The uwang is too big to fit under the bottom of most doors when the doors are properly closed.
</p><p>
</p><p>It's important to have bug screens on window frames and trust me, you can find houses in the Philippines with window frames only, without anything in the frames. During the cool months, windows aren't that important, but bug screens are always important, and not just to keep beetles out. I'm also talking about mosquitoes, dragonflies and praying mantises, all of which have entered my house when doors or windows were open.

</p><p>Years ago, one of my young nieces (a teenager today) was jumping around hysterically, crying and whining at the same time. It took a minute or more to realize which of the beetles had attached it to the backside of the t-shirt she was wearing. Removing her t-shirt from her body was far easier than removing the uwang from her t-shirt. It didn't want to let go.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Baybayin (Tagalog pronunciation: [baɪbaˈjɪn], pre-kudlit: ᜊᜊᜌᜒ, virama-krus-kudlit: ᜊᜌ᜔ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜔, virama-pamudpod: ᜊᜌ᜴ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜴; also incorrectly known as alibata) is a Philippine script. The script is an alphasyllabary belonging to the family of the Brahmic scripts. It was widely used in Luzon and other parts of the Philippines prior to and during the 16th and 17th centuries before being supplanted by the Latin alphabet during the period of Spanish colonization. It was used in Tagalog and to a lesser extent Kapampangan speaking areas; its use spread to Ilokanos in the early 17th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries, baybayin survived and evolved into multiple forms—the Tagbanwa script of Palawan, and the Hanuno'o and Buhid scripts of Mindoro—and was used to create the constructed modern Kulitan script of the Kapampangan and the Ibalnan script of the Palawan tribe.[citation needed]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
