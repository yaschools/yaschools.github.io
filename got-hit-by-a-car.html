As you got out of the car, you were intercepted by a crying lady who thought that she was the only one who hit and killed the pedestrian. There were only three people on the scene: you, the lady and the dead person you hit on the road. There were no other witnesses. Thus, you know that whoever is responsible will be sent to jail.

                            16. according to sir Isaac Newtowns first law a body at rest will remain at rest and a body in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force john paul is driving his car going to the market and suddenly he hit the break the car eventually stopped but his body is still in motion causing him to be injured what do you think is the reason why john paul got injured is there any external force applied to stop the bodys motion if there is what is that thing that can help to stop john paul body in motion​</h2><br />
                        I think it is because of unbalanced force. John Paul and the car have inertia. If the car comes to a sudden stop, his body tends to keep moving forward. When the car starts moving again, his body tends to stay at rest. He move forward because the car seat exerts an unbalanced force on his body.<br />

                            26. On your way home one night, you figured in a car accident. While driving your car, you accidentally hit and killed a pedestrian. As you got out of the car, you were intercepted by a crying lady who thought that she was the one who hit and killed the pedestrian. There we're only three people on the scene; you, the lady and the dead person you hit on the road. There were no other witnesses. Thus, oh that whoever is responsible will be sent to jail. What will you do? explain the answer.​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p></p>ANSWER:<p></p>The person who hit and killed a pedestrian must tell the truth, because the their is a lady who thought that she was the one who killed the pedestrian and because of that she's blaming herself why the pedestrian was hit and killed, the lady is so pathetic if she will be the one who will be in the jail, though she is not the one who hit and killed the pedestrian. So the person who hit and killed the pedestrian must tell the truth that he is the one who hit and killed the pedestrian..<p></p><p></p>CARRY ON LEARNINGMAKE ME AS THE BRAINLIEST PLEASE..
