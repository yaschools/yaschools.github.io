                                            pa TagalogOnce a human being believes that this is the time to give up, then it will take place. In that situation, those who remain dreaming ambitiously and wish to change the organization's mentality are called leaders. 1 A few days ago, I gathered all representatives from each sales branch and announced, "we will double our sales." The question was how they took the announcement; Did they find it easy to accomplish or felt that the target is unattainable? People cannot believe something beyond tremendous when they are at the bottom, having an extremely difficult time improving their sales figures​</a>

could anyone please help me? this is my first time making a defense title and i have no idea what to do despite watching multiple videos about defense titles already (most of them are in filipino and i have a hard time understand tagalog despite being a filipino ToT)
our topic or title or whatever is "The Effects of Fossil Fuel: Is it Harmful to the Environment?"</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Firstly, a defense title is a concise and clear statement that summarizes the main point or argument of your research project. It should be brief and to the point, and provide a clear indication of the purpose and scope of your work. In the case of your topic, "The Effects of Fossil Fuel: Is it Harmful to the Environment?", it seems that your research is focused on examining the environmental impact of the use of fossil fuels.</p><p></p><p>To start, you can break down your title into three key components:</p><p></p><p>The Effects of Fossil Fuel - This part of your title indicates the focus of your research, which is on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source that is extracted from the earth, and include coal, oil, and natural gas.</p><p></p><p>Is it Harmful - This part of your title introduces the central question of your research, which is whether the use of fossil fuels is harmful to the environment. This question can be further refined by identifying specific aspects of the environment that are impacted by the use of fossil fuels, such as air pollution, water pollution, and climate change.</p><p></p><p>To the Environment - This part of your title indicates the scope of your research, which is focused specifically on the environmental impact of fossil fuels. It is important to be clear and specific about the scope of your research in your defense title, as this will help your audience understand the focus of your work.</p><p></p><p>Based on these three key components, you can revise your defense title to make it more concise and clear. Here's an example of a revised defense title:</p><p></p><p>"The Environmental Impact of Fossil Fuels: Assessing the Harmful Effects on Air, Water, and Climate"</p><p></p><p>I hope this helps you to better understand how to craft a defense title for your research project. Good luck with your defense!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
