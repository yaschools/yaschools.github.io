                                            ( Identify the Setiing, Conflict, Character, plot, theme, resolution.I have cried bitterly only twice in my life: once when my old girlfriend left me and once when my cat died. Mop was very special to me. Her death taught me not to delay getting proper care for loved ones.Mop came into my life as a kitten. Her mother died when she was very small, so I raised her all by myself. I took her to work every day and gave her milk every hour for two or three weeks until she was big enough to stay home. When Mop was two or three years old, I took in a stray Tom cat and Mop soon got pregnant. Mop got sick shortly after she had kittens. Her kittens all died and she got weaker and weaker. She ate and drank very little and spent most of her time lying on the floor and staring into space. I thought about taking her to the vet, but I did not want to spend all that money and I hoped that she would eventually just get well on her own. Finally, she looked so sick and unhappy that I gave in and took her to the vet. He said she was too far gone and would soon die. I took her home and watched her carefully. A day or two later, she died in my arms. As I held her thin body in my hands, I remembered all the fun we had and the times I was mean to her. I felt my heart breaking and I cried hard for ten minutes. Then I wrapped her in a plastic bag and took her to Monkey Mountain, where I buried her in an unmarked grave beside a trail.I felt bad about waiting so long to take Mop to the vet and I decided that if any of my pets or family members got sick, I would not wait to take them to the doctor. If I had acted sooner, Mop might still be alive, or at least she would not have suffered so much for so long.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>THE BIRD: A STORY OF LOVE<p></p><p>One day, a small child discovered a bird squawking for aid on the ground. The child felt sorry for the bird and gently petted it. He wanted to help it but didn't know how. So he carefully picked up the bird, transported it home, and presented it to his parents. They bathed the bird and discovered it to be slightly injured. To recuperate, it would take time and attention. The child instantly offered to look after the bird because it had become important to him.</p><p></p><p>He started feeding the bird and dashed outside to gather grass to make a cozy nest for it. He placed the nest next to his bed. The boy and the bird were sleeping and living together at this point. The boy and the bird quickly became close friends. The bird was overjoyed and grateful, and the youngster was overjoyed to have made a new friend. The bird was given a name and became a beloved member of the family. With time, it fully healed and began to hop and jump a little, as well as flex his wings. Everyone was even happier as a result of this. It would soon be able to fly, which would be fantastic!</p><p></p><p>But then what? The young man grew contemplative and began to reflect. - If the bird were to start flying today, they would have to keep the windows shut or the bird would just fly away one day. That, however, should not occur. The child adored his pal and couldn't bear the thought of being separated from him. He should undoubtedly remain with him indefinitely. But how do you do it? It was not possible to keep the windows shut all the time. No, it's preferable to get the bird a cage. But what does that imply for his pal? The bird would be enslaved. It would feel suffocating. Its gratitude and affection would transform into disappointment, anguish, and perhaps hatred. It would be a total disaster. The youngster was perplexed; what should he do?</p><p></p><p>His parents were devout Christians. “If you truly love the bird, you should not consider your own interests, but just how to make your friend happy,” they told their son. A bird's nature is to fly in the open sky; it cannot be content in a cage.” That was difficult for the youngster. But, in the end, he opened his heart and the windows. And then the bird actually flew away one day. But notice what happened: whenever the youngster saw a bird flying in the sky, he thought to himself, "How happy he must be!" That's got to be one of my pals!” And his bird was overjoyed and grateful to the youngster, and he informed the other birds about it. As a result, all birds became his pals, and he was constantly surrounded by them. Instead of losing a friend, he gained a slew of new ones.</p><br />

                            20. ( Identify the Setiing, Conflict, Character, plot, theme, resolution.I have cried bitterly only twice in my life: once when my old girlfriend left me and once when my cat died. Mop was very special to me. Her death taught me not to delay getting proper care for loved ones.Mop came into my life as a kitten. Her mother died when she was very small, so I raised her all by myself. I took her to work every day and gave her milk every hour for two or three weeks until she was big enough to stay home. When Mop was two or three years old, I took in a stray Tom cat and Mop soon got pregnant. Mop got sick shortly after she had kittens. Her kittens all died and she got weaker and weaker. She ate and drank very little and spent most of her time lying on the floor and staring into space. I thought about taking her to the vet, but I did not want to spend all that money and I hoped that she would eventually just get well on her own. Finally, she looked so sick and unhappy that I gave in and took her to the vet. He said she was too far gone and would soon die. I took her home and watched her carefully. A day or two later, she died in my arms. As I held her thin body in my hands, I remembered all the fun we had and the times I was mean to her. I felt my heart breaking and I cried hard for ten minutes. Then I wrapped her in a plastic bag and took her to Monkey Mountain, where I buried her in an unmarked grave beside a trail.I felt bad about waiting so long to take Mop to the vet and I decided that if any of my pets or family members got sick, I would not wait to take them to the doctor. If I had acted sooner, Mop might still be alive, or at least she would not have suffered so much for so long.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Skip to main content</p><p></p><p>￼</p><p></p><p>English 111</p><p></p><p>Unit 4: Types of Writing</p><p></p><p>Narrative Essays</p><p></p><p>What is Narrative Writing?</p><p></p><p>When you write a book report or tell a story or explain what happened first, second, and third you are giving a narrative account. Narrative writing is commonly used when we want to share our ideas with others. We write about what we like, what’s important to us, and what we think others will enjoy reading. Narrative writing is descriptive writing, but it is not usually associated with academic writing that requires higher-order thinking skills, including the research components described in Bloom’s taxonomy (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation).</p><p>Narrative writing is often associated with fiction writing. We write about people who do things. We write about a struggle and how it is overcome. We usually write from a particular perspective or point of view: “Let me tell you about my first day in public school. It still stands out as one of the worst days of my life…..” or “Going to first grade for me was so exciting! I could hardly wait to get there, and when I look back at that wonderful day with a beautiful teacher and all those new people I’d never seen before, I still get a thrill.”</p><p>You can see from the two above examples that narratives are often written in first person. Readers are encouraged to be a part of the author’s world. They’re invited into that world by the author’s words and images and details. Narrative writing involves vivid, descriptive examples of people and events.</p><p>If you think of narrative writing as storytelling, you can begin a short narrative project. Consider the essential elements of a story: it must have a setting, it must contain characters, there must be a particular plot or story line, a problem (sometimes called ‘conflict’) must come into play to help move the story along, there must eventually be a resolution to the problem, and the story must be told from someone’s perspective (or point of view). We’ll look at each of these elements of narrative writing:</p><p></p><p>Setting</p><p></p><p>Characters</p><p></p><p>Plot</p><p></p><p>Problem and Resolution</p><p></p><p>Perspective, often called Point of View</p><p></p><p>Setting</p><p></p><p>￼“It was a dark and stormy night.” There’s a setting for you. Charlie Brown’s dog, Snoopy, began his great American novel with that opening line. It sent chills down every child’s spine just thinking about Snoopy looking out drearily from within the shelter of his dog house!</p><p>A setting must be somewhere. The story you are telling must take place in some specific place at some specific time, whether it’s in a space ship on its way to another galaxy or the attic in your house. It can certainly be an imaginary place, but even imaginary places have to be described. Your reader must have a sense of place. If you’re writing about a log cabin in the woods, is it a vacation cabin that your family rents each summer, with all the modern conveniences (including WiFi), or is it a pioneer family’s crudely-constructed hut quickly built from scavenged logs in the Wyoming wilderness of 1820? The characters and story that you develop are clearly dependent on the setting you develop for the reader.</p><p></p><p>Characters</p><p></p><p>Your setting needs to have characters that do things connected to the place you’ve put them in. If you’re writing about dogs and cats, you don’t necessarily need people. In that case, the dogs and cats are your characters. If you do have people, they’ll be interacting with each other in some way. Dogs, cats, and people (and any characters you create) will have names and personalities and they will speak to each other and deal with all the situations in your story.</p><p>You may be very creative with your characters, assigning very particular characteristics to each. You need main characters and supporting characters. Your narrative will be about a person or two or three people who interact within the plot of your narrative. Characters can be heroic “protagonists” and their arch enemies, the “antagonists,” who are out to get them. Characters are needed to move the story through the events needed to get from the beginning to the end.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
