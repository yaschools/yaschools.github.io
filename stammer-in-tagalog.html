                                            The young man bowed low as the king entered the room. When he raised his eyes, he gasped in astonishment as he noticed that the king looked very similar to the begger, he met on the way. The king saw the shock in the man's eye and said," Yes, I was the beggar you met on your way." "But...bu...bu... why did you dress up like a beggar. You are king. Well, then, why did you do this to me?" the young man stammered after gaining some composure. "Because I had to be sure that you had a good heart and genuinely love your fellow human beings," said the king. "I knew that if I came to you asking, you would have done anything to impress me. But that way I would never have known what is truly in your heart. So I used a ruse. Beggar had nothing to offer you. The generosity and love to the one in need without expecting anything in return is the sign of a great heart. Looking at your love and generosity towards the beggar proved that you sincerely love your fellow human beings. This country needs a leader who would work for the welfare of all of the nation, not just ones who would offer and cater to the throne. You have proved that you are the right person to be my successor," promised the king.

                                            MAIN IDEA: High-school proms should be banned. A. Proms pressure students to spend a ridiculous amount of money on gowns, tuxes, flowers, and even limos or cars Prom preparations distract students for many weeks from the real business of school, which is education. In addition, the social pressure to get a date for the prom makes many people miserable. B. Proms usually feature a theme, and the room the prom is held in is decorated according to that theme. Often a photographer is hired to take pictures of the couples as they arrive. Some proms even have thrones set up for the prom king and queen. C. At most schools, proms are chaperoned by teachers and administrators. Of course, the students would prefer that no adults were in the room, especially adults who should stay in the classroom or office where they belong. What they don't realize is that the chaperones are often as ill at ease as the students they are watching 2 MAIN IDEA: Speaking before a group is a problem for many people. A. Many people will go to almost any length to avoid speaking to a group. If they are forced to do it, they can feel so anxious that they actually develop physical symptoms. If asked, people will often prefer that anything happen to them as an alterative to having to speak in public. B. Some people will pretend to be ill to avoid speaking publicly. Stage fright, stammering, and blushing are frequent reactions. When asked to rank their worst fears, people often list public speaking as even worse than death.​</a>

Well, then, why did you do this to me?" the young man stammered after gaining some composure. "Because I had to be sure that you had a good heart and genuinely love your fellow human beings," said the king. "I knew that if I came to you asking, you would have done anything to impress me. But that way I would never have known what is truly in your heart. So I used a ruse. Beggar had nothing to offer you. The generosity and love to the one in need without expecting anything in return is the sign of a great heart.

And for other people it's because they don't see themselves a part of the Deaf community, so they think it's better to not call themselves Deaf as well. It can get a little bit complex in that way as well. But in general, calling someone d/Deaf is absolutely acceptable</p><br />

                            26. MAIN IDEA: High-school proms should be banned. A. Proms pressure students to spend a ridiculous amount of money on gowns, tuxes, flowers, and even limos or cars Prom preparations distract students for many weeks from the real business of school, which is education. In addition, the social pressure to get a date for the prom makes many people miserable. B. Proms usually feature a theme, and the room the prom is held in is decorated according to that theme. Often a photographer is hired to take pictures of the couples as they arrive. Some proms even have thrones set up for the prom king and queen. C. At most schools, proms are chaperoned by teachers and administrators. Of course, the students would prefer that no adults were in the room, especially adults who should stay in the classroom or office where they belong. What they don't realize is that the chaperones are often as ill at ease as the students they are watching 2 MAIN IDEA: Speaking before a group is a problem for many people. A. Many people will go to almost any length to avoid speaking to a group. If they are forced to do it, they can feel so anxious that they actually develop physical symptoms. If asked, people will often prefer that anything happen to them as an alterative to having to speak in public. B. Some people will pretend to be ill to avoid speaking publicly. Stage fright, stammering, and blushing are frequent reactions. When asked to rank their worst fears, people often list public speaking as even worse than death.​</h2><br />
