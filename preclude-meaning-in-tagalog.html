                                            John purchased roofing materials worth P20, 000 from RCV Construction Company owned by Rico and paid the latter a check in the said amount. The following day, Rico deposited the check but it was returned dishonored because it was drawn against a closed account. John failed to make good the said check despite written demands. Atty. Torredes, counsel for Rico, filed two complaints against John with the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor, one for estafa under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code and another for violation of BP Blg. 22. Atty. Luardo, counsel for John, claimed that if his client was at all liable, he could only be liable for violation of BP 22 and not for estafa under Art. 315 of the RPC because one precludes the other and because BP 22 is more favorable to the accused as it carries a lighter penalty. The investigating prosecutor, on his resolution, stated that only one crime was committed, namely, the complex crime of estafa under Art. 315 of the RPC and another under BP 22. Is the investigating prosecutor, correct? Explain.</a>

                                            The Cask of AmontilladoBy Edgar Allan PoeTHE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had bome as I best could, but when heventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will notsuppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was apoint definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded theidea of risk. I must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed whenretribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to makehimself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause todoubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did notperceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.He had a weak point - this Fortunato - although in other regards he was a man tobe respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Fewitalians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit thetime and opportunity to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. Inpainting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of oldwines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: -- was skillful in theItalian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I couldIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season,that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had beendrinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and hishead was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that Ithought I should never have done wringing his hand.​</a>

                            11. John purchased roofing materials worth P20, 000 from RCV Construction Company owned by Rico and paid the latter a check in the said amount. The following day, Rico deposited the check but it was returned dishonored because it was drawn against a closed account. John failed to make good the said check despite written demands. Atty. Torredes, counsel for Rico, filed two complaints against John with the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor, one for estafa under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code and another for violation of BP Blg. 22. Atty. Luardo, counsel for John, claimed that if his client was at all liable, he could only be liable for violation of BP 22 and not for estafa under Art. 315 of the RPC because one precludes the other and because BP 22 is more favorable to the accused as it carries a lighter penalty. The investigating prosecutor, on his resolution, stated that only one crime was committed, namely, the complex crime of estafa under Art. 315 of the RPC and another under BP 22. Is the investigating prosecutor, correct? Explain.</h2><br />

                        <p>The questions mainly test a <strong>student's knowledge of widely used vocabulary in English</strong></p><p>In learning a language, in this case English, its <strong>vocabulary </strong>often times becomes a <strong>hindrance that could put someone's off during the time of learning</strong>. It is because <strong>there are millions of words or even more.</strong> </p><p>However, the <strong>most popular or well known words are not that big in number.</strong> It never hurts to remember more, and it can be achieved by reading texts in <strong>English </strong>and searching for their <strong>definition in a dictionary and thesaurus</strong>. Meanwhile, as for the answers of the questions asked:</p><p></p><p>1. The correct answer would be <strong>impersonating</strong>, because the second phrase talks about <strong>"take off the President", meaning that the comedian acts like the President.</strong></p><p>2. The answer to this blank should be <strong>limited</strong>, because other words are used in different context.</p><p>3. Oblivious, because there is an adverb "<strong>completely</strong>", that indicates the <strong>highest impact of the adjective</strong>. <strong>Among the five choices, oblivious fits that criteria.</strong></p><p>4. The only word that goes with "<strong>out</strong>" in this sentence is <strong>robbed</strong>, hence the answer is robbed.</p><p>5. The answer is <strong>ensure </strong>because it means <strong>"to make sure of", "to increase the probability of something"</strong></p><p>6. The "<strong>for hours</strong>" indicates that it happens<strong> for few more time, so lingered is the answer that fits that definition.</strong></p><p>7. Here, the choice "<strong>revealed</strong>" is the correct one because its meaning is similar to "<strong>displayed</strong>"</p><p>8. The context here is an<strong> inability to do something</strong>, and <strong>could not afford </strong>is one phrase that fits that definition.</p><p>9. Because the <strong>condition is not fulfilled</strong>, then the student is <strong>excused</strong>. <strong>Exempted </strong>is the answer because it means the same thing as <strong>excused</strong>.</p><p>10. <strong>Concern </strong>means <strong>business</strong>, and that fits with the phrase <strong>"wouldn't tell them anything".</strong></p><p></p><p>Learn more about tips on how to remember English vocabulary by clicking this link: https://brainly.ph/question/4252798</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            17. The Cask of AmontilladoBy Edgar Allan PoeTHE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had bome as I best could, but when heventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will notsuppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was apoint definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded theidea of risk. I must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed whenretribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to makehimself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause todoubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did notperceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.He had a weak point - this Fortunato - although in other regards he was a man tobe respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Fewitalians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit thetime and opportunity to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. Inpainting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of oldwines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: -- was skillful in theItalian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I couldIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season,that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had beendrinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and hishead was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that Ithought I should never have done wringing his hand.​</h2><br />
