                                            Characteristics of Sound Sound is described by three characteristics: •Pitch •Loudness •Intensity Pitch is the highness or lowness of sound. Males have low-pitched voice because their vocal cords are typically massive and longer than females. Can you name some popular Filipino singers with high-pitched voice? Loudness and Intensity are closely related. Intensity of sound refers to the amount of energy of a sound wave. It is measured in decibel. Loudness on the other hand is subjective. It is a sensation acquired by hearing which depends on how people perceived sounds. Usually, a high intensity sound produces a louder sound, and a low intensity sound creates a softer sound. As the intensity becomes higher, the frequency and energy also become high. low frequency, Low pitch, longer wavelength high frequency, High pitch, shorter wavelength Figure4. Relationship among frequency, pitch and wavelength Source: AuthorRead the questions carefully and write your answer in a separate sheet of paper. 1. Differentiate pitch, intensity and loudness. 2.

Choose only the letter of the correct answer.Better than a Chinese restaurant is the kitchen of a kababayan. When in ai foreign city, a Pinoy searches every busy sidewalk, theater, restaurant for the well-remembered golden features of a fellow-Pinoy. But make no mistake. It is only becausei he is in desperate need of Filipino meal and, like a homing pigeon, he follows his nose toa Filipino kitchen that is well stocked with bagoong, patis, garlic, balat ng lumpia, gabi1 leaves and misua.When the Pinoy finally finds such a treasure-house, he will have every meali with his Kababayan. Forgotten are the bistros and the smart restaurant. The back of hishand to the Four Seasons and the Tour d' Argent. Ah, the regular orgies of cooking and ii eating that ensue. He may never know his host before. In Manila, if he saw him again,they would hardly exchange two words. But here in this odd, barbarian land wherei people eat inedible things and have never heard of patis, they are brothers forever.The Filipino may denationalize himself but not his stomach. He may travel over theseven seas and the five continents and the two hemispheres and lose the savor of homeand forget his identity and believe himself a citizen of the world. But he remains the1 gastronomically, at least-always a Filipino. For, if in no other way, the Filipino loves hiscountry with his stomach.i (Excerpt from "Where's the Patis?" by Carmen Guerrero-Nakpil)D. anxiousD. wittyD. to describe1.What is the tone of the excerpt?A. hopeful B. nostalgic C. witty2.

Hundreds of boxing fans expressed disappointment about the public performance of Bautista, who was expected to sing the anthem professionally. Bautista offered an apology to the public after the incident saying "I apologize to the Filipino people for the lapse of memory that occurred during my rendition of the national anthem. He promised to sing the national anthem with mastery next time​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Regarding the incident you mentioned, it is important for individuals who are tasked with singing the national anthem in public to take their responsibilities seriously and perform it accurately and respectfully. Christian Bautista's mistake of forgetting two lines of the national anthem during a public performance was understandably disappointing to the audience, who were expecting a professional and flawless rendition. His apology and promise to sing the national anthem with mastery next time is a step in the right direction, and it is important for all performers to take their responsibilities seriously and ensure that they are fully prepared before public performances.</p><p></p><br />

Read the answer of the former Ms, Universe Catriona Gray during the Miss Universe pageant while at least one paragraph expressing your opinion about the life of a Filipino "I worked a lot in the slums of londo, Manila. And the life there. It's poor, and it's very sad And I've always taught myself to look for the beauty in it. To look in the beauty in the faces of the children, and to be grateful And I would bring this aspect as a Miss Universe to see situation with a silver lining, and to assess, where I could give something, where I could provide something, as a spokesperson, and if I could teach also people to be grateful, we could have an amazing world where negativity could not grow and foster, and children would have a smile on their faces."

Many times, he told her of his love and begged her to become his wife, but she always refused, for she did not like him, One day when she saw Mr. Spider coming again, Miss Fly closed all the doors and windows of her house and made ready a pot of boiling water. She waited, and when Mr. Spider called, begging her to allow him to enter, she answered by throwing boiling water at him. This made Mr. Spider very angry and he cried, "I will never forgive you for this, but I and my descendants will always despise you. We will never give you any pence."

                            29. Characteristics of Sound Sound is described by three characteristics: •Pitch •Loudness •Intensity Pitch is the highness or lowness of sound. Males have low-pitched voice because their vocal cords are typically massive and longer than females. Can you name some popular Filipino singers with high-pitched voice? Loudness and Intensity are closely related. Intensity of sound refers to the amount of energy of a sound wave. It is measured in decibel. Loudness on the other hand is subjective. It is a sensation acquired by hearing which depends on how people perceived sounds. Usually, a high intensity sound produces a louder sound, and a low intensity sound creates a softer sound. As the intensity becomes higher, the frequency and energy also become high. low frequency, Low pitch, longer wavelength high frequency, High pitch, shorter wavelength Figure4. Relationship among frequency, pitch and wavelength Source: AuthorRead the questions carefully and write your answer in a separate sheet of paper. 1. Differentiate pitch, intensity and loudness. 2. How is pitch and wavelength of soundwave related to each other? 3. How loudness differs with the person? 4. As an ambulance approaches and passes you, how can you explain the sound it produced? 5.

The wavelength of the sound (these pressure waves) decreases, and the frequency increases. That results in a higher sound pitch.

Choose only the letter of the correct answer.Better than a Chinese restaurant is the kitchen of a kababayan. When in ai foreign city, a Pinoy searches every busy sidewalk, theater, restaurant for the well-remembered golden features of a fellow-Pinoy. But make no mistake. It is only becausei he is in desperate need of Filipino meal and, like a homing pigeon, he follows his nose toa Filipino kitchen that is well stocked with bagoong, patis, garlic, balat ng lumpia, gabi1 leaves and misua.When the Pinoy finally finds such a treasure-house, he will have every meali with his Kababayan. Forgotten are the bistros and the smart restaurant. The back of hishand to the Four Seasons and the Tour d' Argent. Ah, the regular orgies of cooking and ii eating that ensue. He may never know his host before. In Manila, if he saw him again,they would hardly exchange two words. But here in this odd, barbarian land wherei people eat inedible things and have never heard of patis, they are brothers forever.The Filipino may denationalize himself but not his stomach. He may travel over theseven seas and the five continents and the two hemispheres and lose the savor of homeand forget his identity and believe himself a citizen of the world. But he remains the1 gastronomically, at least-always a Filipino. For, if in no other way, the Filipino loves hiscountry with his stomach.i (Excerpt from "Where's the Patis?" by Carmen Guerrero-Nakpil)D. anxiousD. wittyD. to describe1.What is the tone of the excerpt?A. hopeful B. nostalgic C. witty2.
