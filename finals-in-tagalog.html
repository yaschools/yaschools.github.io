                                            [RIZAL AND EDUCATION]
Finally, Rizal viewed education as something revolutionary not in a subversive and violent sense, but in freeing the mind from the darkness and bonds of ignorance. A free mind however must be aware of the different issues of his or her society. He or she must be actively engaged in trying to change society for the better.

Finally, Rizal viewed education as something revolutionary not in a subversive and violent sense, but in freeing the mind from the darkness and bonds of ignorance. A free mind however must be aware of the different issues of his or her society. He or she must be actively engaged in trying to change society for the better.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Jose Rizal, Father of the Filipino people, in his Noli Me Tangere (1887) in chapter 19, “Adventures of a Schoolmaster,” described the Spanish days of education as “working to turn my boys into parrots so that they will know by rote so many things about which they do not understand a single word: (p.103). From time immemorial the rod had been the characteristic of the school… I had been made to believe that it was the only efficient way of compelling study.”</p><p></p>Jose Rizal wanted a changed philosophy when he states, “Now I cam to think that, far from helping the child to progress, [the rod] held him back considerably. I was convinced that it was impossible to think in the face of rod and whip; apprehension, fear, upset even the most self-possessed; a child’s imagination is all the more impressionable because it is more lively<p></p><br />

Kahit na ang reason ng pag inom nila ay para mag saya. Hindi parin sapat yun kasi may iba pa namang paraan na maaari nilang gawin para mag celebrate hindi ang mag inom. At tsaka alam nila na magagalit yung parents nila pag nalaman na uminom sila pero ginawa parin nilang uminom. I can say that this is quite connected with peer pressure. But they have a choice and still, they choose to drink making them responsible for their choices in life. (lol)</p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />
