11. Violet pulled her hair back into a ponytail. She was stressed. For the third time this week, a teacher was going to call her home and she knew that she wouldn't be able to talk her way out of this one. She thought that she would try anyway. "Come on, Mr. Jones," she pleaded. "I didn't mean to do it. I just held out my hand and he ran into it." Mr. Jones smirked and replied, "Yeah, nice try, Violet, but here's the deal. When one of my students gets hurt, we call homes and that's it." Violet buried her face in her palms. *

12. The sun was beginning to set. Light rays pierced through the hills and I could see the stars awakening on the other side of the sky, but I did not want to go home. "Give me one more try. I'll get it this time," I pleaded with Jake. He tilted his head to the side, crinkled his face, and said, "Look, if you couldn't do it the last thousand times, you're probably not going to get it right now. Why don't you get your own skateboard, then you can work on your tricks all day and night?" He was right. I needed to get my own skateboard. *

13. "You can't do it. You'll never do it," said my cousin Victor as I stood at the free-throw line. I turned around so that my back was to the hoop and began bending backward. I could now see the hoop, but it was upside down. I held the ball against my inverted chest. "Come on, you know you can't do it. Just take the letter," Victor continued goading me but I wasn't trying to hear that nonsense. I wound back and released the ball. It flew from my hands in a perfect arc and soared directly over the backboard. "I told you so," Victor said smugly.

14. Hank brushed the sweat and dirt from his brow. He looked carefully at the crystal mass. These rocks had formed over millions of years. They were beautiful, but they were in the way of the gold. Hank spooled the wire out about twenty feet from the crystal mass. He took cover behind a cave wall and ordered the men to move back before he hit the switch. Boom! Crystal fragments exploded outward and settled on the cave floor. "All clear!" Hank shouted. *

For the third time this week, a teacher was going to call her home and she knew that she wouldn't be able to talk her way out of this one. She thought that she would try anyway. "Come on, Mr. Jones," she pleaded. "I didn't mean to do it. I just held out my hand and he ran into it." Mr. Jones smirked and replied, "Yeah, nice try, Violet, but here's the deal. When one of my students gets hurt, we call homes and that's it." Violet buried her face in her palms.

12. The sun was beginning to set. Light rays pierced through the hills and I could see the stars awakening on the other side of the sky, but I did not want to go home. "Give me one more try. I'll get it this time," I pleaded with Jake. He tilted his head to the side, crinkled his face, and said, "Look, if you couldn't do it the last thousand times, you're probably not going to get it right now. Why don't you get your own skateboard, then you can work on your tricks all day and night?" He was right. I needed to get my own skateboard.

13. "You can't do it. You'll never do it," said my cousin Victor as I stood at the free-throw line. I turned around so that my back was to the hoop and began bending backward. I could now see the hoop, but it was upside down. I held the ball against my inverted chest. "Come on, you know you can't do it. Just take the letter," Victor continued goading me but I wasn't trying to hear that nonsense. I wound back and released the ball. It flew from my hands in a perfect arc and soared directly over the backboard. "I told you so," Victor said smugly.

14. Hank brushed the sweat and dirt from his brow. He looked carefully at the crystal mass. These rocks had formed over millions of years. They were beautiful, but they were in the way of the gold. Hank spooled the wire out about twenty feet from the crystal mass. He took cover behind a cave wall and ordered the men to move back before he hit the switch. Boom! Crystal fragments exploded outward and settled on the cave floor. "All clear!" Hank shouted.
