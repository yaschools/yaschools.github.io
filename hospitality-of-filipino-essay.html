This is the most common terminology that describes how Filipinos welcome foreigners or tourists who visit the country. This trait of the Filipinos towards their visitors is undeniably exceptional. Whenever a visitor stays in a Filipino home, there will be a feast or a grand celebration as it is somehow a tradition for us to prepare bountiful Filipino cuisine for guests to have a taste of our culture through food. In addition, a cheerful family would typically be ready to accommodate and spend time with the visitors. To add to that, Filipino families are often more than willing to share not only their meals but their entire home as well. As a matter of fact, Filipinos would usually greet their visitors with the phrase "Feel at home!" to ensure that they are at ease during their stay. For Filipinos, it is a pleasure and the country's honor to accept foreigners as visitors and build genuine relationships and friendships with them. Indeed, this clearly shows that Filipinos are a warm and loving people. They give and share what they have for their guest even it means a little sacrifice on their part.

DIGITAL BAYANIHAN AMID COVID-19Experts all over the world believe that to mitigate the effects and end the spread of the Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), all sectors of the society must work hand in hand to fight the deadly virus.It is not the sole responsibility of the government to stop the global pandemic, and it is imperative for people to join in the efforts and collectively stop the virus from further infecting anyone.This rings true in the Philippines, where the spirit of Bayanihan is slowly being revived amid the onslaught of natural and man-made catastrophes that struck the whole country during the first three months of 2020.Various non-government organizations and even individuals have started calling on Filipinos to help in the war against the pandemic, whether it’s through volunteerism or through monetary donations.Donations drives have been launched by various groups to help protect frontline healthcare workers from the virus. These came amid the reported scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPEs) in hospitals.Likewise, groups and individuals are seeking support to fund relief goods for the families that are in need of food and personal hygiene kits, as major cities and provinces and provinces impose in their own community quarantine protocols.There are hundreds of more donations drives that are hundreds of more donations that are happening across the Philippines today, signaling the strong revival of the Filipino culture of Bayanihan—only that with the strict implementation of community quarantines and social distancing protocols, donations are facilitated through mobile phones.Source: globalnation.inquirer.net (posted March 2019) Questions:1.

There are numerous good reasons why many tourists visit the Philippines.  Firstly, I believe that the Philippines is known for its hospitable people. Filipinos are very welcoming and accommodating. I am certain that these Filipino characteristics are very attractive to many foreigners.  In my experience, Filipinos are always ready to help other people in need. They are generous.

They take the view that Philippine islands and beaches are breathtaking, and there are a lot of sea adventures to experience and delicious local foods to partake and share. Also, the Philippines has a unique culture to learn and appreciate. I cannot deny that I agree with all these thoughts.  In conclusion, I am convinced that many foreigners love the Philippines. That is why, they continue to visit it and others even choose to stay in the country. ​</a>

                                            An Ideal Citizen 1. A citizen is a person who lives in a state and is governed by its laws in all matters. An ideal citizen is an asset to a nation. Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3.

These came amid the reported scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPEs) in hospitals.Likewise, groups and individuals are seeking support to fund relief goods for the families that are in need of food and personal hygiene kits, as major cities and provinces and provinces impose in their own community quarantine protocols.There are hundreds of more donations drives that are hundreds of more donations that are happening across the Philippines today, signaling the strong revival of the Filipino culture of Bayanihan—only that with the strict implementation of community quarantines and social distancing protocols, donations are facilitated through mobile phones.Source: globalnation.inquirer.net (posted March 2019) Questions:1.

There are numerous good reasons why many tourists visit the Philippines.  Firstly, I believe that the Philippines is known for its hospitable people. Filipinos are very welcoming and accommodating. I am certain that these Filipino characteristics are very attractive to many foreigners.  In my experience, Filipinos are always ready to help other people in need. They are generous.

Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great. A poet has rightly said: “Not gold, but only men, can make a nation strong and great; Men who for truth and honour’s sake.1. What concept is discussed and clarified in this essay?
