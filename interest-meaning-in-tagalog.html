                                            inequality in one variable. History of Carmona In the late 16th century, a Spanish colonial resettlement program was implemented across wide areas of what came to be known as the province of (EXAMPLE) CAVITE. The program was designed to integrate the Filipinos into the religious and political institutions of the Spaniards. (1)__________ was first established as a mission town in 1595. Together with the other mission towns in the province, it became one of the centers of religious and economic activities in the first centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Carmona used to be a barrio of the Mission Town of Silang. It was locally known as "(2)_____________ "", a tagalog word for plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. At that time, this barrio was just a small farming community with a very small population. As its population rapidly increased, religious and political separation from the town of Silang was later sought from Spain. Eventually, it became an independent municipality on February 20, 1857 by virtue of the Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de (5)__________ The name (3_______) was adopted as a sign of gratitude to the Spanish officials who influenced the Central Government at the time of separation of the barrio. With boundaries properly delineated and a church established, it started its own religious and political administration. The people of Carmona have actively participated in the revolution against the Spaniards. It also witnessed the Filipinos' resistance against the Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation, some of Carmona's prominent houses were used as Japanese headquarters while the hills became the stronghold of Filipino revolutionaries After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions or land conflicts.​</a>

They encourage change and raise public awareness of social concerns while supplying local communities with the resources they require to develop fresh initiatives that meet their specific requirements.

                            12. Elaborate/Ipaliwanag in Tagalog•Multimedia and Interactivity•Interative media are means of communication in which the output values depend on input. These means that the user is actively involved in the communication. The media still has the same purpose, but entries and inputs made by user create the interactions and some interesting options when it comes to the output of the system. Interactive media is reffered to conceptual design of interaction, new media, interactivity, interaction between people and computers, graphical user interface, digital culture, interactive design, and virtual reality.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:Multimedia at Interaktibidad•</strong></p><p><strong>Ang interative media ay paraan ng komunikasyon kung saan ang mga halaga ng output ay nakasalalay sa input. Nangangahulugan ito na ang gumagamit ay aktibong kasangkot sa komunikasyon. Ang media ay mayroon pa ring parehong layunin, ngunit ang mga entry at input na ginawa ng user ay lumikha ng mga pakikipag-ugnayan at ilang mga kawili-wiling opsyon pagdating sa output ng system. Ang interactive na media ay tumutukoy sa konseptong disenyo ng pakikipag-ugnayan, bagong media, interaktibidad, pakikipag-ugnayan sa pagitan ng mga tao at mga computer, graphical na user interface, digital na kultura, interactive na disenyo, at virtual reality.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
