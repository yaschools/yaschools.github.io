This was no reflection on Filipino men- of the American occupation. First, it was humanly impos- sible for the Filipino nation to recover quickly from the paralyzing effects of the repression in thought and speech which has been their lot under Spanish rule. The Filipinos could not, therefore, take immediate advantage of their newly acquired right to be heard. Second, the Filipinos first had to learn a medium alien to them in its psychology, construction, sound, and spelling. Third, even if after they had learned the English language sufficiently for ordinary communication, they discovered that literary standards for English differed radically from those in the vernacular literatures (or in Spanish which formed part of the herit- age of the more fortunate).​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The culture of the Philippines is a combination of cultures of the East and West.[1] Filipino identity was created primarily as a result of pre-colonial cultures, colonial influences and foreign traders intermixing and gradually evolving together. In pre-colonial times, the Philippines was a divided set of nations, islands and tribes being ruled by their own kings, chieftains, lakans, rajahs, datus and sultans. Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger empire outside of what is now the Philippines. Manila, for example, was once part of the Islamic Sultanate of Brunei, and the Sulu Archipelago was also part of the Hindu Majapahit. The advent of colonial rule in the islands marked the beginning of the Philippines as an entity, a collection of Southeast Asian countries united under Spanish Empire.</p><p></p><p>Chinese influence has been felt throughout Southeast Asia through trade, specifically by the Ming dynasty and other earlier dynasties from as early as the 9th century. The blending of indigenous, colonial and external influence is very evident in the historic arts and traditions of the country.</p><p></p><p>The Philippine archipelago was first settled by Negritos; today, although few in numbers, they preserve a very traditional way of life and culture. After them, the Austronesians arrived on the archipelago. The Austronesian culture is strongly evident in the ethnicities, languages, cuisine, music, dance and almost every aspect of the culture. These Austronesians engaged in trading with other Austronesians, particularly in the neighbouring nations in Maritime Southeast Asia. They also traded with the Mainland Southeast Asia, as well as Japan, China, the Indian subcontinent and Arabia. As a result, some of these cultures marked their influences on Filipino culture. This gradually evolved with indigenous belief systems and developed into Anitism, which became the dominant religion for more than a millennium.[2][3</p><br />

                            20. In the light of social changes, we come to
the question: What qualities should distinguish educated Filipino of today? I venture to suggest that the educated Filipino should first be distinguished by the power to do.
The Oriental Excels in reflective thinking:
he is a philosopher. The Occidental is a doer, he
manages things, men and affairs. The Filipino of
today needs more of this power to translate
reflection into action.
I believe that we are coming more to the
conviction that no Filipino has the right to be
considered educated unless he is prepared to take
an active and useful part in the work, life and
progress of our country as well as in the progress
of the world.
26. What is the best paraphrase of the last

our country is sought by every Filipino.
B. The country's progress and
advancement depends primarily on
educated Filipinos
C. A truly educated Filipino participates
actively in the work and progress of the
country and the world as a whole.
D. To be considered educated, one has to

                            21. For numbers 11 to 15, read the speech below and answer the question that follows. "Patriotism has come to mean love of our countrymen. Each one is a part of us. Each one is a part of the Philippines. You hurt one Filipino and you hurt the whole nation. Every Filipino is an inherent part of our nature. Therefore any misfortune that a Filipino suffers is a misfortune of the entire Philippine archipelago. Thus, perhaps among ourselves, we do not feel intensely the hamm we sometimes inflict upon our own fellow-countrymen. But let a foreigner pull one single hair from a Filipino's head or step ever so lightly on his toes and, as one man, we rise in his defense...
