                                            Summary This lesson highlights the early Greek thinkers and Taoist's views that the human being is merely a part of nature. Discussions on early Greek thinkers and Taoist's views exhort that the human person is but a part of nature. In the age of globalization and technology, many environmentalists argue for limiting all types of consumption and economic activity when these damage the environment. Care and respect for all life forms should not be seen as a fad but as an imperative. As humanity becomes ever busier, we are reminded of our dependence on other life forms. Coexistence with the community and reexamining our attitude to nature call for a new order. Finally, this lesson adheres to coexistence with all things, thus enlarging our awareness of the universe as with Taoist belief and of other thinkers who view humanity as merely one element, "a dot in the universe." Humanity is no more, and no less important than all the other elements of the natural world.paki hanap ho ung important details.. thanks ​</a>

All: Glory to you, O Lord.
THE CROWDS asked John the Baptist, “What should we do?” He said to them in reply, “Whoever has two cloaks should share with the person who has none. And whoever has food should do likewise.” Even tax collectors came to be baptized and they said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?” He answered them, “Stop collecting more than what is prescribed.” Soldiers also asked him, “And what is it that we should do?” He told them, “Do not practice extortion, do not falsely accuse anyone, and be satisfied with your wages.” Now the people were filled with expectation, and all were asking in their hearts whether John might be the Christ. John answered them all, saying, “I am baptizing you with water, but one mightier than I is coming. I am not worthy to loosen the thongs of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fan is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.” Exhorting them in many other ways, he preached good news to the people.
The Gospel of the Lord.
All: Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.</a>

1
St. Paul exhorts the community of believers in his letter to the Ephesians to be one in
Christ.
2. To build communities means to choose those people whom you want to be with and
exclude those you are not comfortable with
BECs are composed of poor families, the rich are therefore excluded from them
4
The members of a community must learn to be a brother or sister to one another
5. The source of our unity in the Church is our bishop and our parish priest
6. A BEC is a small community that is formed to help its members improve their quality
of life.
7. The death of Jesus on the cross reconciles us with one another, thereby effectively
breaking down the barriers that separate us from one another
8. The family is the domestic Church and our mission to build communities begins there,
9. St. Damien shows us that we build communities by means of self sacrifice.
10. Jesus continues to nurture the unity he built by His death through the Holy Eucharist.</a>

1. The Ethical Demand of the Kingdom:
Radical change in the life of the community is exhorted in order to respond in a radical obedience to the call of Jesus on living service to others.
2. Constrast between Present and Future
The Present condition of the community must be prepared and participate in Jesus' suffering and death so that we can share Jesus' triumph in the future kingdom.
3. At the End of Time:
The kingdom is near for those who proclaim, bear the cross and steadfast watchfullness for the second coming of Christ in Parousia. For those who are ashamed of the Son on Man it will bring one condemnation at the end of time.</a>

Discussions on early Greek thinkers and Taoist's views exhort that the human person is but a part of nature. In the age of globalization and technology, many environmentalists argue for limiting all types of consumption and economic activity when these damage the environment. Care and respect for all life forms should not be seen as a fad but as an imperative. As humanity becomes ever busier, we are reminded of our dependence on other life forms. Coexistence with the community and reexamining our attitude to nature call for a new order. Finally, this lesson adheres to coexistence with all things, thus enlarging our awareness of the universe as with Taoist belief and of other thinkers who view humanity as merely one element, "a dot in the universe."

                        <p>This lesson emphasizes the importance of recognizing that humans are just one part of the natural world. It discusses the perspectives of early Greek thinkers and Taoists who believed in the interconnectedness of all life forms. In the modern era, environmentalists advocate for limiting human consumption and economic activity that harm the environment. Respect for all life forms should not be seen as a trend but rather as a necessity. As we become increasingly busy, it is crucial to remember our dependence on other living things. Coexisting with nature requires a shift in our attitudes and a new approach to our relationship with the environment. Ultimately, this lesson emphasizes the importance of recognizing humanity's place in the universe as just one element among many.</p><br />

THE CROWDS asked John the Baptist, “What should we do?” He said to them in reply, “Whoever has two cloaks should share with the person who has none. And whoever has food should do likewise.” Even tax collectors came to be baptized and they said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?” He answered them, “Stop collecting more than what is prescribed.” Soldiers also asked him, “And what is it that we should do?” He told them, “Do not practice extortion, do not falsely accuse anyone, and be satisfied with your wages.” Now the people were filled with expectation, and all were asking in their hearts whether John might be the Christ. John answered them all, saying, “I am baptizing you with water, but one mightier than I is coming. I am not worthy to loosen the thongs of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fan is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.” Exhorting them in many other ways, he preached good news to the people.
