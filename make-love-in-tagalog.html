Lisan, a humble fisherman, mysteriously disappears for eight years before returning home. Bhatia, the wife he has left behind, has remarried in the meantime, but there’s more, and something irrepressible for him to reclaim besides her. Lisan has a royal destiny to be fulfilled.
Kathrina Mohd Daud’s The Fisherman King is an epic novel, anchored in the folk traditions of Brunei. It shares fantastical tales and yesteryear stories which blend magic, fate, sacrifice and national history.
Lisan, adopted and raised in the Water Village, was informed early in life that he was of royal descent. The nanny who had told him passed away before he could ask her more questions. Lisan remains haunted by his parentage and past as he grows up. This loss never fades away even when he meets Bhatia, his soulmate, in secondary school (and whom he later marries). Love, and the bond between Lisan and Bhatia seems unbreakable. Yet, she is not able to make him renounce his obsession over investigating his family origins. One day he leaves her and everything behind. Their reunion after eight years is at first uneasy, bittersweet, with a new man now settled in Bhatia’s life.</a>

                                            Tagalog meaning of Friendships are ties formed by two or more people who want to interact with one other. It entails taking an interest in one another's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Friendships are built on trust, respect, emotional support, and admiration. Life's too short to waste your days with someone who make you feel unworthy and unappreciated. Spend it with friends who makes you laugh and feel loved.
I hope you understand how much having you in my life means to me. You have made my problems lighter and my life better. You've been there when the weather was good and stood with me in the rain, you've laughed with me in the good times and the bad, and you've even shared my sorrow. I adore everything about you because you're more than just a friend to me; you're also my best friend and a bro.</a>

Sit, enjoy it if ya cool
Haters can snooze
While I put my city on the map

Never forgettin' the street where my
Cousin would sit when we always just listen to rap
Kendrick, Em, and A$AP with some metal
And man we would turn up with that
Been mundane till the sun came
Now I want fame like a kid in the trap, uh

Claimin' they listen

3 stars and a sun, aye
Blue, red draped down on a flag
No we never fear none
Most of us didn't grow up with a trust fund
Know that I'm willin' to kill for a loved one

Discriminated in my own home country
Sure, some would be like
Luh amputi puti mo... tisoy

And I swear that
Nobody will ever look at me the
Same way again
I'll make it to the top while I be showin

Nanalo na ako nung mula pa na
Pinugutan si Lapu sa Mactan
At lahat ang nasaktan na
Nalaman nila na pinatay

Aside from bouts of sabayang pagbigkas practice hours, heated Balagtasan contests and countless plays recreating iconic “Noli Me Tangere” and “El Filibusterismo” scenes, the subject propelled our appreciation for Philippine literature. This was through the award-winning Filipino short stories we were tasked to read—and most importantly—analyze. Admit it: You enjoyed it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, with Bob Ong’s thriller novel “Ang Mga Kaibigan ni Mama Susan” and Ricky Lee’s short story “Servando Magdamag,” turning into films soon, we’re pumped now more than ever. What if we give the same opportunity to the stories that grew up with us? Here are award-winning stories written by Filipino authors that we want to see onscreen—whether as a show or a movie. It’s the spotlight Philippine literature deserves.</p><br />

Lisan, a humble fisherman, mysteriously disappears for eight years before returning home. Bhatia, the wife he has left behind, has remarried in the meantime, but there’s more, and something irrepressible for him to reclaim besides her. Lisan has a royal destiny to be fulfilled.
Kathrina Mohd Daud’s The Fisherman King is an epic novel, anchored in the folk traditions of Brunei. It shares fantastical tales and yesteryear stories which blend magic, fate, sacrifice and national history.
Lisan, adopted and raised in the Water Village, was informed early in life that he was of royal descent. The nanny who had told him passed away before he could ask her more questions. Lisan remains haunted by his parentage and past as he grows up. This loss never fades away even when he meets Bhatia, his soulmate, in secondary school (and whom he later marries). Love, and the bond between Lisan and Bhatia seems unbreakable. Yet, she is not able to make him renounce his obsession over investigating his family origins. One day he leaves her and everything behind. Their reunion after eight years is at first uneasy, bittersweet, with a new man now settled in Bhatia’s life.</h2><br />

1st true Filipino rapper on the news
Sit, enjoy it if ya cool
Haters can snooze
While I put my city on the map
22-double the O-longapo City no cap
Never forgettin' the street where my
Cousin would sit when we always just listen to rap
Kendrick, Em, and A$AP with some metal
And man we would turn up with that
Been mundane till the sun came
Now I want fame like a kid in the trap, uh
Aye, I been in Spain
Spain
But the letter 'S' is silent

So I can water crops for survivin'
Rain rain

Claimin' they listen
Listen listen

3 stars and a sun, aye
Blue, red draped down on a flag
No we never fear none
Most of us didn't grow up with a trust fund
Know that I'm willin' to kill for a loved one

Discriminated in my own home country
Sure, some would be like
Luh amputi puti mo... tisoy

And I swear that
Nobody will ever look at me the
Same way again
I'll make it to the top while I be showin

Nanalo na ako nung mula pa na
Pinugutan si Lapu sa Mactan
At lahat ang nasaktan na
Nalaman nila na pinatay
Ang kanilang bayani
Sa karagatan ng bansa
Na pag-aari
