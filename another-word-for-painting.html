You can easily make one by following these simple directions. First, bend your pipe cleaner to make the frame of your dinosaur. I suggest you create a tyrannosaurus frame by using one long pipe cleaner as his neck, spine, and tail, and then bend another into a u-shape to make his feet. Wrap the feet around the spine piece. Next, roll out clay to wrap around the pipe cleaners. Let the clay dry overnight. The next day you may want to paint your dinosaur using non-toxic paint. His eyes should be white, but feel free to color your dinosaur as you wish. Nobody really knows how dinosaurs were colored, so don't let anyone tell you that your dinosaur can't be pink. Lastly, put him on your desk and watch as he or she scares away bullies and pencil thieves. 19. What type of informational text structure does this selection belong? 20.

                            18. Creating a Dinosaur Sculpture Materials: pipe cleaners, clay, non-toxic paint Wouldn't you like a scary dinosaur model on your desk to protect your pencils and textbooks? You can easily make one by following these simple directions. First, bend your pipe cleaner to make the frame of your dinosaur. I suggest you create a tyrannosaurus frame by using one long pipe cleaner as his neck, spine, and tail, and then bend another into a u-shape to make his feet. Wrap the feet around the spine piece. Next, roll out clay to wrap around the pipe cleaners. Let the clay dry overnight. The next day you may want to paint your dinosaur using non-toxic paint. His eyes should be white, but feel free to color your dinosaur as you wish. Nobody really knows how dinosaurs were colored, so don't let anyone tell you that your dinosaur can't be pink. Lastly, put him on your desk and watch as he or she scares away bullies and pencil thieves. 19. What type of informational text structure does this selection belong? 20.

Description</p><p>This is pretty straightforward. Texts that use this structure simply describe something. With few exceptions, these texts also present plenty of details about what they're describing.</p><p></p><p>A text using this structure might also:</p><p></p><p>Tell you why something is being described</p><p>Tell you why the described topic is important</p><p>Provide examples of the described topic(s)</p><p>Descriptive texts are everywhere—in novels, works of literary nonfiction, news articles, science textbooks—which makes sense because the entire point of description is to present information.</p><p></p><p>2. Sequence/Instruction/Process</p><p>This text structure covers a few purposes:</p><p></p><p>Sequential instructions (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3; do this, then do that, and finally do this)</p><p>Chronological events (This happened, then this happened, then this happened, etc.)</p><p>Arguments that use evidence to support a claim (presenting evidence from least to most convincing)</p><p>When students read or write a text with this structure, order is key. Texts that use this format usually don't present any event or instruction out of order, as doing so would make its directions more difficult to follow.</p><p></p><p>As a ludicrous example, imagine a cake recipe in which preheating the oven is the last step. It would just be confusing and odd. Poorly written instructions just aren't worth your time.</p><p></p><p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of words and phrases that indicate a text follows the sequence/instruction/process text structure:</p><p></p><p>after	before	during	earlier</p><p>eventually	finally	first	from</p><p>how to	in order	last	meanwhile</p><p>next	now	until	while</p><p>3. Cause/Effect</p><p>Cause/Effect text structures explain, well, causes and effects. Sounds pretty simple! But works that use this structure can become complex when an effect has multiple causes (or vice versa).</p><p></p><p>Students will encounter complex examples of cause-effect when they read historical texts. Many events in history had more than one cause, all related in ways that can be difficult to unpack.</p><p></p><p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of words and phrases that indicate a text follows the cause/effect text structure:</p><p></p><p>because	cause	led to	reason</p><p>accordingly	effect	result	consequence</p><p>4. Compare/Contrast</p><p>This text structure involves a comparison involving multiple things, revealing how they are similar and how they are different.</p><p></p><p>Make sure your students know that contrasting two or more things doesn't necessarily mean identifying them as either good or bad. Comparisons simply relay the differences; therefore, one thing could have both positive and negative traits.</p><p></p><p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of words and phrases that indicate a text follows the compare/contrast text structure:</p><p></p><p>alike	also	both	comparable</p><p>even	in common	just as	similar</p><p>although	but	despite	difference</p><p>however	instead	otherwise	unlike</p><p>5. Problem/Solution</p><p>This text structure involves two parts:</p><p></p><p>The author identifies a problem</p><p>The author details a solution to this problem</p><p>Problem/Solution can be a very complex text structure, as it necessitates the use of other structures, too. Clearly, the author needs to describe the problem. The author would likely also explain the causes and effects of the problem in order to argue in favor of their solution. Does implementing the author's solution involve following a series of specific steps? That involves another structure. What if the author wants to mention other potential solutions and then explain why their solution is the best one? Oh, hello there, Compare/Contrast!</p><p></p><p>What's important here, as it is with any text in which an author marshals an argument, is that the author uses only the information needed to advance the argument or refute counterarguments. When students examine a text that uses the Problem/Solution text structure, they should examine at least two things: the argument as a whole and the individual components of it.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that aspects of other text structures might appear in the Problem/Solution one will help students examine the argument's individual components. That's why it's essential that students understand and can analyze the other four structures if you want them to be able to examine Problem/Solution effectively.</p><p></p><p>Looking for a series that makes teaching informational material easier?
