Fill in the diagram with details correctly synthesizing the essential information, "Hospitality is a trait displayed by every Filipino, characterized by heart warming generosity and friendliness exhibited to foreigners and locals alike, Filipinos receive guests, even strangers, in a warm and pleasant way, often going out of their way to make the visitor comfortable. It is a trait not confined to the upper class and can be found among the poorest members of society. Even today, when guests arrive in Filipino homes during mealtime, they are offered whatever is being served for that meal. Most of the time, a new meal is prepared to the liking of the visitor. The Filipino hospitality is best exemplified in regard to foreign guests, who are treated with the utmost respect. Filipinos enjoy the company of foreign visitors, and most foreigners who have visited the country can testify to the warmth and friendliness of the locals. Excerpt quoted from: Why Are Filipinos Known to Be Hospitable?  "What makes Filipinos different from many other nationalities is that they openly welcome you to become a part of them. Filipino hospitality is hospitality not only to Filipinos, but to everyone, including non-Filipinos. Perhaps it's because they have been colonized by Spain and subsequently the United States, so they are used to having foreigners around. However, what's amazing is that Filipinos are excited and proud to show you what it means to be Filipino and welcome you to partake in the Filipino culture as if it were your own. Unlike other cultures where foreigners have a difficult time integrating, many foreigners who visit the Philippines "feel at home."

Filipinos are well-known for being hospitable. 5. Filipinos want to stay in the Philippines.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. In my opinion, not all Filipino families have strong family ties as this may vary depending on different factors such as culture, upbringing, and personal experiences. While the value of family is deeply ingrained in Filipino culture, there are some families who may not prioritize or prioritize it differently.</p><p></p><p>2. I disagree with the statement that global warming does not affect the activities of people. Global warming has a significant impact on our environment and natural resources, affecting our daily activities such as agriculture, transportation, and energy consumption. Ignoring the impact of global warming can have serious consequences for our planet and future generations.</p><p></p><p>3. I believe that the statement "rich people are always happy" is not true. Happiness is not solely dependent on material possessions or financial status. While having financial stability can contribute to one's happiness, it is not the only factor that determines one's emotional well-being.</p><p>4. I agree that Filipinos are well-known for being hospitable. Hospitality is a cultural value that is deeply ingrained in Filipino culture. Filipinos are known to welcome guests warmly, offer food and drinks, and make them feel at home.</p><p></p><p>5. I cannot make a stand on the statement "Filipinos want to stay in the Philippines" as it is a broad generalization. While some Filipinos may prefer to stay in the Philippines, others may seek better opportunities abroad or for personal reasons. It is important to acknowledge that every individual has different aspirations and goals in life.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>1We Filipinos have taken the slogan “reduce, reuse, and recycle” to heart. We like to maximize the lifespan of an object in every possible way, lest it go to waste. This is one of our positive habits until we invite guests to our kitchen or dining area.</p><p></p><p>A typical Filipino fridge is usually stocked with recycled plastic bottles in all sizes containing drinking water. In the same manner, we love buying hefty glass jars of instant coffee or peanut butter because they can be reused as drinking glasses.</p><p></p><p>Well, it’s all fun and games until someone gets hurt (or dies!) of either cancer from the chemicals leaching off the overused plastic bottles, or food poisoning from the ancient containers getting contaminated with a sundry of condiments and other substances that haven’t been washed off thoroughly.</p><p>2Speaking of rice, there’s no doubt we Filipinos are a rice-eating people. We consider meals without rice to be mere snacks, and all a restaurant has to do to get our attention and money is to offer “unlimited rice.”</p><p></p><p>Despite knowing the horrible effects of excessive carb consumption on our health (see ‘diabetes,’ ‘obesity,’ and ‘just plain feeling sleepy most of the time’), we insist on having our favorite carbohydrate with practically everything.</p><p></p><p>Is our obsession with rice just another chapter from our nation’s multi-volume book, Making the Most of What’s in Front of You? Both my siblings could eat rice with nothing but ripe mangoes or bananas—I kid you not. But regardless of this addiction’s root cause—whether biological, social, or cultural—this is one “Unli-“ offer that wouldn’t hurt our country if it expired</p><br />

It is a trait not confined to the upper class and can be found among the poorest members of society. Even today, when guests arrive in Filipino homes during mealtime, they are offered whatever is being served for that meal. Most of the time, a new meal is prepared to the liking of the visitor. The Filipino hospitality is best exemplified in regard to foreign guests, who are treated with the utmost respect. Filipinos enjoy the company of foreign visitors, and most foreigners who have visited the country can testify to the warmth and friendliness of the locals. Excerpt quoted from: Why Are Filipinos Known to Be Hospitable?  "What makes Filipinos different from many other nationalities is that they openly welcome you to become a part of them. Filipino hospitality is hospitality not only to Filipinos, but to everyone, including non-Filipinos. Perhaps it's because they have been colonized by Spain and subsequently the United States, so they are used to having foreigners around. However, what's amazing is that Filipinos are excited and proud to show you what it means to be Filipino and welcome you to partake in the Filipino culture as if it were your own. Unlike other cultures where foreigners have a difficult time integrating, many foreigners who visit the Philippines "feel at home."
