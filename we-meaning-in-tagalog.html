Tiongson(1) THERE IS NO doubt that cinema has risen as one of the most popular means ofmass communication in contemporary Philippines. Movie theaters dot cities, townsand other important commercial centers from Aparri to Jolo. Through thesetheaters, Nora Aunor has truly become a national figure and tagalog has risen tothe status of a real national language. Indeed, movie theaters have become asimportant to us today as churches were in the last century.(2) Because movies have become one of the most important means ofcommunication, it is high time that the Filipinos examined the values encounteredin and propagated by, the movies. These values at the general worldview arisingfrom them inevitably mold the Filipino's consciousness for better or for worse, in aneffective, if insidious, manner through stories that entertain.(3) Sad to say, the principal values encountered in most Filipino movies today arethe same negative values they have inherited from the traditional dramas whichmigrated, so to speak, from stage to screen, and provided the latter, for the longesttime, with both form, content and most of all, world-view. Four of these valueswhich we must single out for their prevalence, perseverance and perniciousnessmay ne encapsulated in the following statements: 1) Maganda ang Maputi (White isbeautiful), 2) Masaya ang may Palabas (Shows are the best), 3) Mabuti ang Inaapi(Hurrah for the Underdog!), and 4) Maganda pa ang Daigdig (All is Right with theworld)Comprehension Guide Questions: 3 points each1.

Indeed, how heartbreaking and devasting to only hear from the word "unemployment". But what more could it be when we learn further about it? What does "unemployment" really mean? Is it just the lack of one's source of living? Or is there more to it than just that? What are the news and articles pertaining to it trying to address? What are they trying to imply? What happens to those affected by this certain issue? The people, their families, status, lifestyle, their country? And oh, the economy. A lot of questions linger in our minds, leaving us a mark on what "unemployment" really is, and how far it can go and affect us. These questions, they add up and increase; yet, they remain unanswered. Thus, the making of this essay has a major goal of fulfilling the thoughts, untiringly lingering in our minds about the true essence of "unemployment", its aspects, effects, how to cope with it, and more.​</a>

                                            translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</a>

Let us make a Concept Map about the measures of central tendency and use the numbers shown from the cards to identify the mean, median, mode, range, and interquartile range. Solution: The picture above illustrates the tabletop game using cards. This game is called Solitaire (Solitaryo in tagalog ay larong nagsasanay ng utak) and can be played by one person. This is popular among people even in the old times, particularly in a remote area. In San Pablo City, we can observe our grandparents playing these tabletop game cards solely while resting after a hard time working from the farm. Solitaire is an excellent way to diffuse any tension in one's mind or body and helps the person enjoys the day or get to sleep better at night; enough sleep keeps the body healthy. It gives the mind something to focus on, particularly in times of low action when the opportunity to fret is high, Let us use the number in each card in reviewing the concepts about the measures of central tendency and variability These numbers are :7.10,8, 4, 6,3,7 By Concept Mapping you can easily organize your knowledge learned from the previous lessons you had when you were in grade 8 CONCEPT MAP द/ average highest frequency MEAN MODE Measures of Central Tendency​</a>

                                             pa tagalog plsss Japanese management once attracted global attention It was very difficult for Westerners to understand why employees work so hard for a company. Many observers concluded that Japan must have had some magical 1 t 3 management system. But they were wrong. The Japanese work force has been rooted in a tradition that values diligence. The reason some Japanese enterprises excel is that their employees share this set of values and work hard for the company. In the next decade the new generation, which grew up in more affluent times, will form the majority in the work force, and individualism will come to the forefront. The decline of Japanese companies could thus begin if excessive individualism leads their people to lose 2 appreciation for the value of work. In the United States today, companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which advocates corporate ideals and philosophy, continue to prosper. No company should rely solely on employees' native diligence or traditional values to succeed. We must set forth a company philosophy for our young employees, share with them the real meaning of work, and give them a purpose in life.​</a>

                            9. FOUR VALUES IN FILIPINO DRAMA AND FILMNicanor G. Tiongson(1) THERE IS NO doubt that cinema has risen as one of the most popular means ofmass communication in contemporary Philippines. Movie theaters dot cities, townsand other important commercial centers from Aparri to Jolo. Through thesetheaters, Nora Aunor has truly become a national figure and tagalog has risen tothe status of a real national language. Indeed, movie theaters have become asimportant to us today as churches were in the last century.(2) Because movies have become one of the most important means ofcommunication, it is high time that the Filipinos examined the values encounteredin and propagated by, the movies. These values at the general worldview arisingfrom them inevitably mold the Filipino's consciousness for better or for worse, in aneffective, if insidious, manner through stories that entertain.(3) Sad to say, the principal values encountered in most Filipino movies today arethe same negative values they have inherited from the traditional dramas whichmigrated, so to speak, from stage to screen, and provided the latter, for the longesttime, with both form, content and most of all, world-view. Four of these valueswhich we must single out for their prevalence, perseverance and perniciousnessmay ne encapsulated in the following statements: 1) Maganda ang Maputi (White isbeautiful), 2) Masaya ang may Palabas (Shows are the best), 3) Mabuti ang Inaapi(Hurrah for the Underdog!), and 4) Maganda pa ang Daigdig (All is Right with theworld)Comprehension Guide Questions: 3 points each1.

                            17. translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Turuang mabuti ang mga kabataan at hindi kailangang parusahan ang mga kalalakihan.</p><p>( parang... mula pagkabata sana'y ituro sa mga kalalakihan ang pagrespeto at pagprotekta sa mga babae.. Upang sa paglaki nila'y ito ang moral nila.. Sa halip na makisama sa napakatagal na pambabastos ng napakaraming kalalakihan sa mga babae o kaya'y hindi pagrespeto , ito'y kanilang iiwasan at bigyan ng katapusan sa mga ito.)</p><p>2. Ang pagkilala sa sarili ang pinakamahirap gawin sa buhay. </p><p>(Para sa akin, mula pagkabata ay ating kinikilala ang ating kapuwa ngunit hindi natin nakikilala ang ating sarili. Mula lamang sa opinyon ng iba natin nakikilala ang ating sarili kahit iba mang opinyo'y hindi totoo. Sa paglipas ng panahon, napakaraming 'experience' ang mag-'sheshape' sa iyong pagkatao kaya't papalit palit ang kung sino tayo.. Sabi nga nila, napakahirap ma-achieve ang 'self-love' kumpara sa pagmahal sa kapuwa.)</p><p></p><p>3.

Kapag ika'y palaging 'diskontento' sa lahat ng bahay, iyong sinasayang ang kung anumang nasaiyo. Hindi mo ma-eenjoy ang buhay kapag hindi mo tanggapin ang kung anumang meron ka. Pagkatapos mong ma-achieve ito, kasiyahan mo ang magpapakita ng kagandahan ng buhay. Kasiyahan natin ang layunin ng ating buhay. smthin like that)</p><p></p><p>4. Ang kahusayan ay hindi isang biyaya.

Sa katunayan ay tayo'y 'mahusay' sa paggawa ng 'tama'.</p><p>( Ang pagiging perpekto o mahusay ay hindi sapat lamang upang ika'y matawag na nasa 'tama'.. Walang naipapanganak na perpekto.. Ito'y naaaral. Ngunit hindi dahil kilala ka bilang 'mahusay' ay palagi kang tama... Ngunit kapag ika'y palaging gumagawa ng tama, ikaw ay mahusay... </p><br />

Let us make a Concept Map about the measures of central tendency and use the numbers shown from the cards to identify the mean, median, mode, range, and interquartile range. Solution: The picture above illustrates the tabletop game using cards. This game is called Solitaire (Solitaryo in tagalog ay larong nagsasanay ng utak) and can be played by one person. This is popular among people even in the old times, particularly in a remote area. In San Pablo City, we can observe our grandparents playing these tabletop game cards solely while resting after a hard time working from the farm. Solitaire is an excellent way to diffuse any tension in one's mind or body and helps the person enjoys the day or get to sleep better at night; enough sleep keeps the body healthy. It gives the mind something to focus on, particularly in times of low action when the opportunity to fret is high, Let us use the number in each card in reviewing the concepts about the measures of central tendency and variability These numbers are :7.10,8, 4, 6,3,7 By Concept Mapping you can easily organize your knowledge learned from the previous lessons you had when you were in grade 8 CONCEPT MAP द/ average highest frequency MEAN MODE Measures of Central Tendency​</h2><br />

                            22.  pa tagalog plsss Japanese management once attracted global attention It was very difficult for Westerners to understand why employees work so hard for a company. Many observers concluded that Japan must have had some magical 1 t 3 management system. But they were wrong. The Japanese work force has been rooted in a tradition that values diligence. The reason some Japanese enterprises excel is that their employees share this set of values and work hard for the company. In the next decade the new generation, which grew up in more affluent times, will form the majority in the work force, and individualism will come to the forefront. The decline of Japanese companies could thus begin if excessive individualism leads their people to lose 2 appreciation for the value of work. In the United States today, companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which advocates corporate ideals and philosophy, continue to prosper. No company should rely solely on employees' native diligence or traditional values to succeed. We must set forth a company philosophy for our young employees, share with them the real meaning of work, and give them a purpose in life.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang pamamahala ng Hapon ay minsang nakaakit ng pandaigdigang atensyon Napakahirap para sa mga Kanluranin na maunawaan kung bakit ang mga empleyado ay nagtatrabaho nang husto para sa isang kumpanya. Napagpasyahan ng maraming tagamasid na ang Japan ay may ilang mahiwagang 1 t 3 na sistema ng pamamahala. Ngunit nagkamali sila. Nag-ugat ang Japanese work force sa isang tradisyon na pinahahalagahan ang kasipagan. Ang dahilan kung bakit napakahusay ng ilang negosyo sa Japan ay dahil ang kanilang mga empleyado ay nagbabahagi ng hanay ng mga halagang ito at nagsusumikap para sa kumpanya. Sa susunod na dekada, ang bagong henerasyon, na lumaki sa mas mayayamang panahon, ay bubuo ng karamihan sa lakas ng trabaho, at ang indibidwalismo ay mauuna. Ang pagbaba ng mga kumpanyang Hapones ay maaaring magsimula kung ang labis na indibidwalismo ay humantong sa kanilang mga tao na mawalan ng pagpapahalaga sa halaga ng trabaho. Sa Estados Unidos ngayon, ang mga kumpanyang tulad ng Hewlett-Packard at IBM, na nagtataguyod ng mga ideyal at pilosopiya ng korporasyon, ay patuloy na umuunlad. Walang kumpanyang dapat umasa lamang sa katutubong kasipagan o tradisyonal na pagpapahalaga ng mga empleyado upang magtagumpay. Dapat tayong magtakda ng pilosopiya ng kumpanya para sa ating mga kabataang empleyado, ibahagi sa kanila ang tunay na kahulugan ng trabaho, at bigyan sila ng layunin sa buhay.</p><br />
