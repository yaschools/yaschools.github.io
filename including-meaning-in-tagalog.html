                                            translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</a>

                            1. Examples of Herbert Blumer's 3 premises of symbolic interactionism which include the meaning, language and thought in tagalog po ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang tatlong pangunahing pangako ng symbolic interactionism ni Herbert Blumer ay ang kahulugan, wika at pag-iisip. Narito ang ilang mga halimbawa sa bawat isa:</p><p></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>Kahulugan:</p><p>Kapag nakita ng isang tao ang isang pusa, hindi lamang ito isang pusa sa kanyang mata, ngunit mayroon itong iba't ibang kahulugan depende sa kanyang karanasan sa mga pusa at ang kultura at lipunan na kanyang kinabibilangan. Halimbawa, para sa isang taong nagmula sa kulturang na kumakain ng mga pusa, ang pusa ay maaaring naglalarawan ng isang pagkain, samantalang para sa isang taong mahilig sa mga pusa, ang mga ito ay nagsisilbi bilang kaibigan at kasama.</p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>Wika:</p><p>Ang mga tao ay gumagamit ng wika upang magpakita ng kanilang kahulugan at makipag-ugnayan sa ibang mga tao. Sa mga kultura ng Pilipinas, mayroong iba't ibang wika at dayalekto depende sa lugar at kultura. Halimbawa, ang mga Cebuano ay may sariling wika at kahulugan ng mga salita na maaaring hindi maunawaan ng mga Tagalog.</p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>Pag-iisip:</p><p>Ang pag-iisip ng isang tao ay nakabatay sa kanyang mga karanasan, kultura, at kahulugan ng mga bagay. Halimbawa, kapag nakakita ng isang tao ng isang aso na nakatali sa isang poste, maaaring ito ay naghahatid ng pagkabagot at paghihirap, samantalang para sa ibang tao, maaaring ito ay nagpapakita ng pag-aalaga at pagmamahal. Ang kanilang pag-iisip ay nakabatay sa kanilang mga karanasan at kahulugan ng mga bagay.</p><br />

                            5. translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</h2><br />
