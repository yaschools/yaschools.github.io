I was sitting in the class, surrounded by people taking notes and paying attention to how to do equations, which would have been okay if I was supposed to be in an algebra class. In reality, I was supposed to be in geometry, and when I discovered my error, I had already missed the first twenty minutes of a one-hour said, "You're late* That would have been bad enough, but in my next class my history teacher spoke so class When I got to the correct class, all twenty-five students turned and looked at me as the teacher fast I could not follow most of what they said. The only thing I did hear was that we were having a quiz tomorrow over today's lecture. My day seemed to be going better during botany class, that is, until we visited the lab. I had a sneezing fit because of one of the plants in the lab and had to leave the room When I finally finished my classes for the day, I discovered I had locked my keys in the car and had to wait for my brother to bring another set. My first day of school was so bad that I know the rest will have to be better.

______ I have had many adventures while I have been treasure hunting. I have been shipwrecked, been caught in a storm, and had my treasure stolen by pirates.
______ I have many adventures while I am treasure hunting. I just gave you an idea of a few of my adventures like shipwrecks, storms, and pirates.
______ My first adventure happened when I first started treasure hunting. I was part of a crew of a ship that was sailing at sea. All of a sudden, the ship hit a rock and caused it to wreck. Everybody had to jump overboard and swim to an island. Luckily, no one was hurt. We did have to build a new ship before we could continue on our journey.
______ My latest adventure had to do with pirates. We were on an island looking for treasure, but all we had found was a couple of old bottles and chests. We hadn’t found any loot. Pirates came and stole all of our treasure. They just didn’t realize what we had as treasure was really just junk.
______ My next adventure happened when I was again at sea. I was captain of a ship when we got caught in the biggest storm I have ever seen. The storm caused the sea to have really rough waves and we couldn’t steer the ship. We got blown off of our course. It took us an extra month to get home because of the storm.</a>
