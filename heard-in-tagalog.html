                                            What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</a>

                            27. What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</h2><br />
