                                            would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</a>

                                            Virgil was only seventeen years old - still young but his mother thought he was old enough, soshe courted a girl for him.Strange? Perhaps in the city, but in the provinces it is a common thing. Mothers usually choosethe heart's choice of their children. That is why so many unfortunate young find themselves tiedto mates they hardly know, at least at the beginning.But Virgil was in luck. His mother fell in love with a girl who was also the silent choice of his ownheart. He had met her a month before and she had smiled at him. He had smiled at her too, buthad lacked the courage to speak to her.His mother took Virgil to the girl's house one afternoon and introduced him to her. After that sheand the girl's mother left them together and went off to talk about some business of their own.Virgil was still very young. Though good-looking and a bit mischievous with the girls at times, hehad never made love to any of them. So now, he sat before the girl, staring out of the windowand desperately trying to think of something to say."A beautiful sunset, is it not?" he finally said stiffly.The girl looked at him, smiled and nodded, saying "Yes" at the same time.He smiled, although there was really nothing to smile at in what either the girl or he had said.Nevertheless, he smiled again. translate in tagalog​</a>

                            8. would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</h2><br />

His mother fell in love with a girl who was also the silent choice of his ownheart. He had met her a month before and she had smiled at him. He had smiled at her too, buthad lacked the courage to speak to her.His mother took Virgil to the girl's house one afternoon and introduced him to her. After that sheand the girl's mother left them together and went off to talk about some business of their own.Virgil was still very young. Though good-looking and a bit mischievous with the girls at times, hehad never made love to any of them. So now, he sat before the girl, staring out of the windowand desperately trying to think of something to say."A beautiful sunset, is it not?" he finally said stiffly.The girl looked at him, smiled and nodded, saying "Yes" at the same time.He smiled, although there was really nothing to smile at in what either the girl or he had said.Nevertheless, he smiled again. translate in tagalog​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Labing pitong taong gulang pa lamang si Virgil - bata pa ngunit akala ng kanyang ina ay nasa hustong gulang na siya, kaya</p><p>niligawan niya ang isang babae para sa kanya.</p><p>Kakaiba? Marahil sa lungsod, ngunit sa mga probinsya ito ay isang pangkaraniwang bagay. Karaniwang pinipili ng mga ina</p><p>pinili ng puso ng kanilang mga anak. Kaya naman maraming kapus-palad na kabataan ang nakatali</p><p>sa mga kapareha na halos hindi nila kilala, kahit sa simula.</p><p>Pero maswerte si Virgil. Ang kanyang ina ay umibig sa isang batang babae na siya rin ang tahimik na pinili ng kanyang sarili</p><p>puso. Nakilala niya ito noong isang buwan at ngumiti ito sa kanya. Nakangiti din siya sa kanya, pero</p><p>ay walang lakas ng loob na kausapin siya.</p><p>Dinala ng kanyang ina si Virgil sa bahay ng dalaga isang hapon at ipinakilala ito sa kanya. Pagkatapos niyan</p><p>at iniwan silang magkasama ng ina ng batang babae at umalis upang pag-usapan ang tungkol sa kanilang sariling negosyo.</p><p>Napakabata pa ni Virgil. Kahit na maganda at medyo pilyo sa mga babae minsan, siya</p><p>ay hindi kailanman nakipag-ibigan sa alinman sa kanila. Kaya ngayon, umupo siya sa harap ng babae, nakatingin sa labas ng bintana</p><p>at pilit na nag-iisip ng sasabihin.</p><p>"Isang magandang paglubog ng araw, hindi ba?" matigas na sabi niya sa wakas.</p><p>Tumingin sa kanya ang dalaga, ngumiti at tumango, sabay sabing "Oo".</p><p>Ngumiti siya, although wala naman talagang dapat ngitian sa sinabi ng dalaga o niya.</p><p>Gayunpaman, ngumiti ulit siya.</p><p></p><br />
