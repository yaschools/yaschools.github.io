                                            A nationwide survey of Middle School students was conducted to determine whether or not talking or texting on a cell phone can be a distraction.  A total of 37,000  cell phone owners were surveyed and of those surveyed it showed that 9,250  had someone who was talking or texting walk into them.      If 192  students at Sebastian Middle School were randomly surveyed, I would predict that   of them will have someone who was talking or texting walk into them.</a>

                            11. A nationwide survey of Middle School students was conducted to determine whether or not talking or texting on a cell phone can be a distraction.  A total of 37,000  cell phone owners were surveyed and of those surveyed it showed that 9,250  had someone who was talking or texting walk into them.
