                                            Opinion 1: Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of the Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known super power not through force of arms, but by engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal's decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how the rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair resolution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in the Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right; Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratlys islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international law. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its cases against China at the United Nations, the Chines government has dismissed the proceeding and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China's utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines? The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from 26​</a>

                                            Eight years ago, Mr. and Mrs. Santos' newborn and only son was taken away from them just a few weeks after he was born. They have been looking for the child since then. The couple recently advertised a reward for anyone who can find and bring him back to them. Three individuals surfaced, each claiming that he/she has their son. Knowing that you understand the science of genetics, the couple asked for your recommendation on how to determine who among the three claimants possibly have their lost child. You learned that Mr. and Mrs. Santos have the following genotypes: (See the file below.) What will be your recommendation? Justify it.

                                            III. Read closely the following arguments. Then, using the given table, list down the arguments and the connectives used. Write your answer on your answer sheet. 1. President Duterte is the best President our country has ever had. He has cut down massively drugs use and jailed drug traffickers. He has thrown out of office a number of corrupt officials more than any president has done. Finally, He has responded with grace and strength to difficult crisis like the pandemic, disasters and calamities 2. China, being a superpower nation like the United States, has been asserting its dominance against other claimants like the Philippines over the disputed territories in the South China Sea. It refuses to follow the UN Convention of the Laws of the Seas. It has reclaimed large-scale land and other structures. It has also been involved in bullying fishermen over the territories 3. COVID-19, though it has killed millions of people all over the world, is not the deadliest disease ever experienced by humanity. In fact, Ebola kills upwards of 50% of people it infects. The coronaviruses that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) result in death in about 10% of infections and between 30% to 40% of cases, respectively 4. It's not a good idea to leave kids younger than 10 years old home alone. Every child is different, but at that age, most kids don't have the maturity and skills to respond to an emergency if they're alone. Furthermore, results of studies showed negative effects like conduct problems, hyperactivity/ inattention and peer relationship problems. Text No Arguments Connectives/ Conjunctions Used 1 2 3​</a>

                                            The South China Sea dispute has been one of the most contested issues in the past decades. The territory sits in the middle of the Southeast Asian region with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia as major claimant states. Discuss the South China Sea Dispute and identify the role of ASEAN in this issue. Do you think that ASEAN is an effective organization in dealing with the tension between the claimant states particularly in talking with China? How so? Can you provide instances where ASEAN made an action or an effort to bridge diplomacy?

                                            Opinion 1:Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known superpower not through force of arms , but engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal’s decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair solution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right, Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratly islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries it, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its case against China at the United Nations, the Chinese government has dismissed the proceedings and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China’s utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of C more China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines?  The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from using destructive and deadly force on any ship that dares to trespass in their socalled territories? Nothing short of a war will convince China that its territorial ambitions have already exceeded the tolerance of the world. ​What are the merits of the opinions given?</a>

</p><p>Mareresolba lamang ang territorial border dispute sa West Philippine Sea kung papahintulutan ng China ang Pilipinas na gamitin ito ng malaya. Maaring hindi na dumating ang araw na mabawi pa natin muli ang dating atin. Malaki ang epekto ng hidwaan ng Estados Unidos sa nangyayari sa West Philippine Sea, dahil bago pa mangyari ang lahat ay pinalibutan na ng base Militar ng America ang China sa kanluran at silangang bahagi nito. Lingid sa kaalaman ng marami ay “defensive move” ang ginagawa ng China upang hindi makalapit ang mga sandatahang pandagat ng America na nasa Pilipinas, Guam, Japan, Australia at Thailand. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong</p><br />

                            4. Opinion 1: Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of the Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known super power not through force of arms, but by engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal's decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how the rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair resolution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in the Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right; Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratlys islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international law. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its cases against China at the United Nations, the Chines government has dismissed the proceeding and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China's utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines? The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from 26​</h2><br />

Do not forget to properly cite at least one reference.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>YES</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The South China Sea dispute is a territorial and maritime sovereignty issue involving several countries in the Southeast Asian region, including China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. At the heart of the dispute are competing claims over the ownership and control of islands, reefs, and waters in the region. These claims are based on historical, geographical, and legal arguments.</p><p></p><p>China claims the largest portion of the South China Sea, using the so-called "nine-dash line" to delineate its territory. This claim is contested by several Southeast Asian countries, which have overlapping claims based on their own historical and legal arguments. The Philippines, in particular, has been vocal in challenging China's claims, leading to a high-profile legal case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2016.</p><p></p><p>ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) has played an important role in addressing the South China Sea dispute. As a regional organization, ASEAN has promoted dialogue and cooperation among its member states, including those with competing claims in the South China Sea. ASEAN has also engaged with China through the ASEAN-China Dialogue, which was established in 1997. In 2002, ASEAN and China signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which aimed to promote confidence-building measures and prevent the escalation of tensions in the region.</p><p></p><p>However, some observers argue that ASEAN's effectiveness in dealing with the South China Sea dispute has been limited. One challenge is that ASEAN operates on a consensus-based decision-making process, which can be slow and sometimes results in watered-down statements that fail to address the root causes of the conflict. China has also been accused of using its economic and political influence to divide ASEAN and prevent it from taking a unified stance on the issue.</p><p></p><p>Despite these challenges, there have been instances where ASEAN has made efforts to bridge diplomacy in the South China Sea dispute. For example, in 2017, ASEAN and China agreed on a framework for a code of conduct in the South China Sea, which aimed to promote confidence-building measures and prevent the escalation of tensions. However, the framework has yet to be translated into a binding code of conduct, and the dispute remains unresolved.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the South China Sea dispute remains a complex and contentious issue in the Southeast Asian region. ASEAN has played an important role in promoting dialogue and cooperation among its member states and with China. However, its effectiveness in dealing with the tension between the claimant states, particularly in talking with China, has been limited by several challenges. Despite these challenges, ASEAN has made efforts to bridge diplomacy in the South China Sea dispute, although a lasting resolution to the conflict remains elusive.</p><p> ASEAN stands for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which is a regional intergovernmental organization of ten countries in Southeast Asia. The member countries of ASEAN are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. ASEAN was established on August 8, 1967, with the aim of promoting economic growth, social progress, and regional stability among its member countries.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Appeal to Pity</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The fallacy that can be drawn from the situation is <strong>Appeal to Pity</strong>. An appeal to pity relies on provoking your emotions to win an argument rather than factual evidence. Appealing to pity attempts to pull on an audience's heartstrings, distract them, and support their point of view. In this situation, it is difficult for the working student to come on time. However, the absurdity in this situation is that no school opens at that godly hour. However, in response to the argument, the student has the freedom to both study and work. In that case, the student must find ways to do both without compromising each other. Example, the student can seek jobs that begins after his schooling so that he can do his homework, have ample amount of sleep, and come to class on time. </p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/18649721</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>1. The man who is claiming to be the only son of the wealthy elderly couple who died in an accident could not be their son if he is type O blood. The couple were both Type AB and O, and therefore their son would have inherited one of those blood types. Since blood type is determined by genetics and is inherited from one's parents, it is not possible for a person with type O blood to have parents with type AB and O blood. Therefore, it is likely that this man's claim is false and he is not the couple's son.</p><p></p><p>A Punnett square would not be useful in this scenario as it only shows the possible genotypes of offspring based on the known genotypes of the parents. The question is asking about the possibility of the man being the couple's son based on their blood types and his blood type. Since blood type is determined by multiple genes, and also it's not a Mendelian Inheritance pattern, it would be difficult to determine if the man is the couple's son just based on blood type alone. The best way to confirm his identity would be through DNA testing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2. The theoretical percentage of the phenotypes resulting from this cross of heterozygous pink-flower plants would be 25% red, 50% pink, and 25% white. The reason for this is that the allele for red-flower is dominant over the allele for white-flower, but incompletely dominant. This means that when a red-flower allele is paired with a white-flower allele, the resulting phenotype will be pink. So, for every four offspring, one will be red, two will be pink, and one will be white.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3. Hemophilia is a sex-linked disorder, which means that it is caused by a gene located on the X chromosome. Since females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome, the inheritance patterns and frequency of this disorder are different in males and females. In this case, if Mrs. Morales is a carrier of the sex-linked hemophilia allele and Mr. Morales is normal, their daughters will have a 50% chance of being carriers and their sons will have a 50% chance of being hemophiliac.</p><p></p><p><strong>The percentage of each sex will be:</strong></p><p></p><p>• <strong>Hemophiliac</strong>: 50% of the males (4 out of 8)</p><p>• <strong>Carrier</strong>: 50% of the females (4 out of 8)</p><p>• <strong>Normal</strong>: 50% of the females (4 out of 8) + 50% of the males (4 out of 8) = 8 out of 8</p><p></p><p>Please note that the above answer is based on the assumption that the couple's offspring are randomly determined and there is no other genetic factors that may affect the inheritance of the disorder.</p><p></p><p><strong>&lt;</strong><strong>3</strong></p><br />

                            21. Opinion 1:Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known superpower not through force of arms , but engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal’s decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair solution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right, Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratly islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries it, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its case against China at the United Nations, the Chinese government has dismissed the proceedings and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China’s utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of C more China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines?  The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from using destructive and deadly force on any ship that dares to trespass in their socalled territories? Nothing short of a war will convince China that its territorial ambitions have already exceeded the tolerance of the world. ​What are the merits of the opinions given?</h2><br />
