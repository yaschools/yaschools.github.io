[Just Saying] The West Philippine Sea must be saved April 19, 2021 4:04 PM PHT 'China's communist officials may have thoroughly studied President Duterte's psyche and concluded that he cannot talk tough against China in the same way he talks tough against his own people! international tribunal. President Aquino's administration filed a case before the Hague international tribunal, resulting in a victory for the Philippines. The landmark decision was halled all over the world. The West Philippine Sea is again center stage in addition to COVID-19. In international law, there are four stages in case of international conflict - short of war - which the Philippines must undertake. Third, upon receipt of the decision, the Philippines must openly urge the losing country to abide immediately and strictly by the decision, with an admonition that noncompliance will result in further international recourse. President Duterte failed to do this upon official receipt of the West Philippine Sea ruling by his administration in the early part of its term. First, the Philippines should alert the world of the impending trouble. This is what is called "noisy," but not belligerent, diplomacy. President Aquino did that after exhausting to solve the problem through "silent" diplomacy. As head of state, he openly called China "a bully." He criticized China's intrusion, publicly declaring that China's movements in the South China Sea were comparable to Nazi Germany's expansionist agenda before World War 2. By his pronouncements, President Aquino warned the international community that the issues are not only a localized problem, but an international concern. He did the right move. China's garrisons and missiles strategically positioned in the South China Sea must be met by, at the very least, the Philippines' overt act manifesting the preparedness to invoke and operationalize the VFA and the MDT. China's awareness of a definitive retaliatory response from the US pursuant to the latter's VFA and MDT commitments in case of an attack on the Philippines can be an effective deterrent. The Philippines is in a serious mess. If not corrected, it will worsen, leaving an ugly legacy of President Duterte's leadership or, to be more precise, lack of it, in the West Philippine Sea - a facticity second only to Japan's Second World War Philippine occupation. The West Philippine Sea must be saved. Second, if nothing happens, a case should be filed with the -Mel Sta. Maria Questions: 1. What issue is discussed in the article that you have read? 2.

                                            Pursuant to said contract, Menor went to her aunt's residence on June 12, 1991 a Wednesday to deliver petitioners travel documents and plane tickets. Petitioner, in turn, gave Menor the full payment for the package tour. Menor then told her to be at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) on Saturday, two hours before her flight on board British Airways.   Without checking her travel documents, petitioner went to NAIA on Saturday, June 15, 1991 , to take the flight for the first leg of her journey from Manila to Hong Kong. To petitioners dismay, she discovered that the flight she was supposed to take had already departed the previous day. She learned that her plane ticket was for the flight scheduled on June 14, 1991. She thus called up Menor to complain. Discuss the legal implication of the case given above Pasagot naman po​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The goal of the expedition was to find a western route to Asia through the Americas to establish a spice trade route alternative to the Eastern route around Africa under Portuguese control pursuant to the Treaty of Tordesillas. Magellan left Spain on 20 September 1519, sailed across the Atlantic, and discovered the strait that now bears his name, allowing him to pass through the southern tip of South America into the Pacific Ocean (which he named). The fleet performed the first ever crossing of the Pacific, stopping in what is today called the Philippines, where Magellan was killed, and eventually reached the Moluccas, accomplishing its goal. A much-depleted crew finally returned to Spain on 6 September 1522.</p><br />

[Just Saying] The West Philippine Sea must be saved April 19, 2021 4:04 PM PHT 'China's communist officials may have thoroughly studied President Duterte's psyche and concluded that he cannot talk tough against China in the same way he talks tough against his own people! international tribunal. President Aquino's administration filed a case before the Hague international tribunal, resulting in a victory for the Philippines. The landmark decision was halled all over the world. The West Philippine Sea is again center stage in addition to COVID-19. In international law, there are four stages in case of international conflict - short of war - which the Philippines must undertake. Third, upon receipt of the decision, the Philippines must openly urge the losing country to abide immediately and strictly by the decision, with an admonition that noncompliance will result in further international recourse. President Duterte failed to do this upon official receipt of the West Philippine Sea ruling by his administration in the early part of its term. First, the Philippines should alert the world of the impending trouble. This is what is called "noisy," but not belligerent, diplomacy. President Aquino did that after exhausting to solve the problem through "silent" diplomacy. As head of state, he openly called China "a bully." He criticized China's intrusion, publicly declaring that China's movements in the South China Sea were comparable to Nazi Germany's expansionist agenda before World War 2. By his pronouncements, President Aquino warned the international community that the issues are not only a localized problem, but an international concern. He did the right move. China's garrisons and missiles strategically positioned in the South China Sea must be met by, at the very least, the Philippines' overt act manifesting the preparedness to invoke and operationalize the VFA and the MDT. China's awareness of a definitive retaliatory response from the US pursuant to the latter's VFA and MDT commitments in case of an attack on the Philippines can be an effective deterrent. The Philippines is in a serious mess. If not corrected, it will worsen, leaving an ugly legacy of President Duterte's leadership or, to be more precise, lack of it, in the West Philippine Sea - a facticity second only to Japan's Second World War Philippine occupation.

                            21. Pursuant to said contract, Menor went to her aunt's residence on June 12, 1991 a Wednesday to deliver petitioners travel documents and plane tickets. Petitioner, in turn, gave Menor the full payment for the package tour. Menor then told her to be at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) on Saturday, two hours before her flight on board British Airways.   Without checking her travel documents, petitioner went to NAIA on Saturday, June 15, 1991 , to take the flight for the first leg of her journey from Manila to Hong Kong. To petitioners dismay, she discovered that the flight she was supposed to take had already departed the previous day. She learned that her plane ticket was for the flight scheduled on June 14, 1991. She thus called up Menor to complain. Discuss the legal implication of the case given above Pasagot naman po​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are no legal implications in this case. The only obligation of Menor is to provide the ticket, which he did. Although he did make a mistake, it still has no legal implications. Since it is also a mistake that could have been avoided if the petitioner was diligent enough to check her travel documents.
