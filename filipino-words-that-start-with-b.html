                                            Lisa Gu visited the Philippines because she loves clear and pristine waters which the country is famous for. She went on a solo trip and planned to start her beach experience in Siargao Island. She arrived, brimming with excitement however she turned out seriously struggling to reach the hotel where she will be staying. It would have been helpful to her if she asked help from locals or authorities but Lisa is afraid of interacting with Filipinos. She has a belief that dark-skinned people have short temper and are likely to harm others if they get angry. She went on, walking in circles for hours and up in a Filipino restaurant. She saw a Korean tourist talking happily to a Filipino woman who appears to be the owner of the dining place. Witnessing how friendly and hospitable she is to the foreigner, Lisa felt regretful for misjudging Filipinos. She gathered enough confidence to ask help from the woman and instead of giving her the warm expression she was expecting, the woman gave her a cold message, "We don't accept Chinese people here. Because of you, COVID-19 arrived to the Philippines." Lisa heavy-heartedly retreated, too affected to speak a word. Lito, a Filipino resident in the area who happened to see everything, came forward and defended Lisa in the best polite way that he could, so his fellow Filipino would reflect on her actions. In the end, the woman apologized to Lisa which then was replied with words of gratitude from her. Lito and Lisa became friends and she opened up to him her negative judgments about Filipinos before which are now replaced with positive ones. 1.Who among the characters in the narrative is being biased?

If you were Lito and you found out first about Lisa's negative views towards Filipinos, would you still defend her? Why? 6. Have you ever been hurt because of a biased treatment or were you judged by someone without even knowing you? How did it feel for you and how were you able to deal with it?  ​</a>

                                            Exercise 5. Write For A Purpose: Do you know how many overseas Filipino workers are working in the Middle East? Or how many Filipino nurses are employed in the United States and England? You can learn about these when you write a report. A report is a composition that makes use of information from books, magazines, newspapers, the internet and other sources. Here are some steps that can help you write your report. 1. Write about a subject that interests you. Look through books on it. Encyclopedias, almanacs, dictionaries, and magazines are good sources of your needed data. You can also surf the internet for more data. 2. Take notes as you go through your sources. Writing the facts on index cards will help you organize the information you need. You can easily refer to your notes as you write the report. Remember to write the data you gathered in your own words. Jotting down the key words is also helpful. 3. Arrange your notes in a logical order. Go over them and classify them into main ideas and supporting details. Be sure to discard the notes that do not fit into these headings. 4. Make an outline to arrange your information. 5. Write your report. Remember that a report has three main parts. The introduction states the main idea and should capture the interest of your readers. The middle paragraphs or the body of the report gives the facts of the report. Each paragraph usually states the main topic and is supported to subtopics. To achieve unity and smooth flow thought, signal words such as first, then, finally, in addition to, and also may be used. The ending paragraph signals the end of your report. A good ending must be clear. It may summarize the main ideas or state your opinion on the topic. A. List possible subjects for a report. You can brainstorm on other interesting subjects. Then select one that interests you. Gather data from primary or secondary sources and write notes about it. Organize your notes and make an outline. Then write aa draft of your report B. Edit your report. The following questions can help you proofread. 1. Is the topic clearly stated in the introduction? Will the readers be interested in reading your report? 2. Does the body of the report contains relevant information? 3. Does each paragraph start with a new topic? Are there supporting details in each paragraph? 4. Is the ending clear enough to let the readers know that the report is finished?​</a>

Jose Palma's Lyric in Spanish was first published and itwas instantly accepted as fitting lyrics to the hymn.In 1916, English was declared the official language in government offices andschools, so the Spanish lyric had to be changed to English. A literal translation was madeby Martha Lane, an American school teacher who collaborated with Camilo Osias. Thisbecame for a time the official version of our national anthem.After the independence proclamation in 1946, it became necessary to have aversion in Filipino. Finally, in 1956 a stirring lyric in Filipino was approved and won publicacceptance. The Filipino National Anthem has remained unchanged since then.1.

                            10. Lisa Gu visited the Philippines because she loves clear and pristine waters which the country is famous for. She went on a solo trip and planned to start her beach experience in Siargao Island. She arrived, brimming with excitement however she turned out seriously struggling to reach the hotel where she will be staying. It would have been helpful to her if she asked help from locals or authorities but Lisa is afraid of interacting with Filipinos. She has a belief that dark-skinned people have short temper and are likely to harm others if they get angry. She went on, walking in circles for hours and up in a Filipino restaurant. She saw a Korean tourist talking happily to a Filipino woman who appears to be the owner of the dining place. Witnessing how friendly and hospitable she is to the foreigner, Lisa felt regretful for misjudging Filipinos. She gathered enough confidence to ask help from the woman and instead of giving her the warm expression she was expecting, the woman gave her a cold message, "We don't accept Chinese people here. Because of you, COVID-19 arrived to the Philippines." Lisa heavy-heartedly retreated, too affected to speak a word. Lito, a Filipino resident in the area who happened to see everything, came forward and defended Lisa in the best polite way that he could, so his fellow Filipino would reflect on her actions. In the end, the woman apologized to Lisa which then was replied with words of gratitude from her. Lito and Lisa became friends and she opened up to him her negative judgments about Filipinos before which are now replaced with positive ones. 1.Who among the characters in the narrative is being biased? A.Lito B.Lisa C.Owner of the restaurant D.Both A and C 2. Who among the characters in the narrative has prejudice towards others? A.Lisa B.Owner of the restaurant C.Lito D.Both A and B 3.Write down a happening from the narrative in which a person is in the state of being blased. 4. Write down a happening from the narrative in which there is an existence of prejudice. 5. If you were Lito and you found out first about Lisa's negative views towards Filipinos, would you still defend her? Why? 6. Have you ever been hurt because of a biased treatment or were you judged by someone without even knowing you? How did it feel for you and how were you able to deal with it?  ​</h2><br />

                            11. Exercise 5. Write For A Purpose: Do you know how many overseas Filipino workers are working in the Middle East? Or how many Filipino nurses are employed in the United States and England? You can learn about these when you write a report. A report is a composition that makes use of information from books, magazines, newspapers, the internet and other sources. Here are some steps that can help you write your report. 1. Write about a subject that interests you. Look through books on it. Encyclopedias, almanacs, dictionaries, and magazines are good sources of your needed data. You can also surf the internet for more data. 2. Take notes as you go through your sources. Writing the facts on index cards will help you organize the information you need. You can easily refer to your notes as you write the report. Remember to write the data you gathered in your own words. Jotting down the key words is also helpful. 3. Arrange your notes in a logical order. Go over them and classify them into main ideas and supporting details. Be sure to discard the notes that do not fit into these headings. 4. Make an outline to arrange your information. 5. Write your report. Remember that a report has three main parts. The introduction states the main idea and should capture the interest of your readers. The middle paragraphs or the body of the report gives the facts of the report. Each paragraph usually states the main topic and is supported to subtopics. To achieve unity and smooth flow thought, signal words such as first, then, finally, in addition to, and also may be used. The ending paragraph signals the end of your report. A good ending must be clear. It may summarize the main ideas or state your opinion on the topic. A. List possible subjects for a report. You can brainstorm on other interesting subjects. Then select one that interests you. Gather data from primary or secondary sources and write notes about it. Organize your notes and make an outline. Then write aa draft of your report B. Edit your report. The following questions can help you proofread. 1. Is the topic clearly stated in the introduction? Will the readers be interested in reading your report? 2. Does the body of the report contains relevant information? 3. Does each paragraph start with a new topic? Are there supporting details in each paragraph? 4. Is the ending clear enough to let the readers know that the report is finished?​</h2><br />

Jose Palma's Lyric in Spanish was first published and itwas instantly accepted as fitting lyrics to the hymn.In 1916, English was declared the official language in government offices andschools, so the Spanish lyric had to be changed to English. A literal translation was madeby Martha Lane, an American school teacher who collaborated with Camilo Osias. Thisbecame for a time the official version of our national anthem.After the independence proclamation in 1946, it became necessary to have aversion in Filipino. Finally, in 1956 a stirring lyric in Filipino was approved and won publicacceptance. The Filipino National Anthem has remained unchanged since then.1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The quality of mercy" is a speech given by Portia in William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice (Act 4, Scene 1). In the speech, Portia, disguised as a lawyer, begs Shylock to show mercy to Antonio. The speech extols the power of mercy, "an attribute to God Himself."</p><p></p><p>The quality of mercy is not strained.</p><p>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</p><p>Upon the place beneath.
