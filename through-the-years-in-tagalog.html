Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</a>

                                            Jonathan at David
(Tagalog)
Panganay na anak ni Haring Saul si Jonathan. Isa siyang matapang na mandirigma. Sinabi ni David na mas mabilis pa si Jonathan kaysa sa agila at mas malakas pa kaysa sa leon. Dahil si Jonathan ang panganay na anak ni Saul, siya dapat ang susunod na magiging hari ng Israel. Subalit batid niya na si David ang pinili ni Diyos na susunod na magiging hari. Imbes na mainggit, naging matalik na magkaibigan sina Jonathan at David. Nangako silang poprotektahan at ipagtatanggol nila ang isa’t isa. Ibinigay ni Jonathan kay David ang kaniyang damit, espada, pana, at sinturon bilang tanda o simbolo ng kanilang pagkakaibigan. Noong panahong tumatakas si David kay Saul, pinuntahan siya ni Jonathan at sinabing: ‘Huwag kang matakot. Ikaw ang pinili ni Diyos na maging hari, at batid ’yan ng aking ama.’ Ilang beses ding nanganib ang buhay ni Jonathan dahil sa pagtulong sa kanyang kaibigang si David. Alam niyang gustong patayin ni Haring Saul ang kanyang kaibigan, kaya kinausap niya ang kaniyang ama at sinabi: ‘Magkakasala ka kapag pinatay mo si David; wala naman siyang kasalanan sa iyo.’ Si Haring Saul ay nagalit kay Jonathan. Makalipas ang ilang taon, magkasamang namatay sa digmaan sina Haring Saul at Jonathan. Pumalit sa puwesto ng pagiging hari si David. Hinanap ni Haring David ang anak ni Jonathan na si Mepiboset. Nang magkita sila, sinabi ni David kay Mepiboset: ‘Matalik kong kaibigan ang iyong ama, kaya hindi kita pababayaan. Maninirahan ka sa palasyo ko at kakain sa mesa ko.’ Hindi nalimutan ni Haring David ang kanyag kaibigan at pinagpatuloy ang naging pangako kay Jonathan sa pamamagitan ng kanyang naging anak.
(English)
King Saul's eldest son Jonathan. He was a brave warrior. David said that Jonathan was even faster than the eagle and even stronger than the lion. Since Jonathan was Saul's firstborn son, he was to be the next king of Israel. But he knew that God had chosen David to be the next king. Instead of being jealous, Jonathan and David became close friends. They promised to protect and defend each other. Jonathan gave David his garment, sword, bow, and belt as a sign or symbol of their friendship. When David is fleeing from Saul, Jonathan comes to him and says: 'Do not be afraid. You are the one God has chosen to be king, and my father knows that. ’Jonathan’s life was also in danger several times for helping his friend David. He knew that King Saul wanted to kill his friend, so he spoke to his father and said: ‘You will sin if you kill David; he has not sinned against you. ’King Saul was angry with Jonathan. Some years later, King Saul and Jonathan died together in battle. David succeeds him as king. King David sought out Jonathan's son Mephibosheth. When they meet, David tells Mephibosheth: 'Your father is a close friend of mine, so I will not leave you. You will live in my palace and eat at my table. ’King David did not forget his handsome friend and continued the promise made to Jonathan through his son.

                                            would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</a>

                                            inequality in one variable. History of Carmona In the late 16th century, a Spanish colonial resettlement program was implemented across wide areas of what came to be known as the province of (EXAMPLE) CAVITE. The program was designed to integrate the Filipinos into the religious and political institutions of the Spaniards. (1)__________ was first established as a mission town in 1595. Together with the other mission towns in the province, it became one of the centers of religious and economic activities in the first centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Carmona used to be a barrio of the Mission Town of Silang. It was locally known as "(2)_____________ "", a tagalog word for plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. At that time, this barrio was just a small farming community with a very small population. As its population rapidly increased, religious and political separation from the town of Silang was later sought from Spain. Eventually, it became an independent municipality on February 20, 1857 by virtue of the Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de (5)__________ The name (3_______) was adopted as a sign of gratitude to the Spanish officials who influenced the Central Government at the time of separation of the barrio. With boundaries properly delineated and a church established, it started its own religious and political administration. The people of Carmona have actively participated in the revolution against the Spaniards. It also witnessed the Filipinos' resistance against the Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation, some of Carmona's prominent houses were used as Japanese headquarters while the hills became the stronghold of Filipino revolutionaries After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions or land conflicts.​</a>

                                            ano ang tagalog ng "Hrothgar is the King of the Danes in southern Denmark. Through success in battle he has become rich and mighty. As a symbol of his power and prosperity he builds a magnificent mead-hall, called Heorot, in which he and his loyal warriors can feast, drink, boast, and listen to the tales of the scops, the Anglo-Saxon bards. But soon after Heorot is finished, the mirth of the men and the music of the scop anger Grendel, a monster descended from Cain. Grendel raids the hall, snatching men and eating them, then returns to his home in the marsh. He repeats his nightly raids until no one dares sleep in the hall. Heorot, once the symbol of the Scyldings’ greatness, is now a place of shame and terror. This continues for twelve years, until Beowulf, a young warrior of the Geats in southern Sweden, hears about Grendel and, determined to fight the monster, sails to Hrothgar’s lands with fifteen companions.
 Hrothgar, who knew Beowulf’s father Ecgtheow, accepts Beowulf’s offer to fight Grendel and gives him a feast, though Beowulf and Unferth, a warrior loyal to Hrothgar, exchange insults. That night, the warriors sleep in Heorot, with Beowulf keeping watch. Grendel arrives and consumes one of the warriors, then reaches for Beowulf. Beowulf, famous for his powerful grip, which is as strong as the grip of thirty men, struggles with Grendel, tearing off the monster’s shoulder and arm. Grendel returns to the fens to die. His arm is hung as a trophy under the roof of Heorot.
 Hrothgar gives a second feast to celebrate Beowulf’s victory. At the feast, Hrothgar generously rewards Beowulf with treasure. The scop sings again, and Beowulf is praised until nightfall. That night, Grendel’s mother comes to the hall from her home in the bottom of a lake, seeking revenge for the death of her son. She grabs Aeschere, a favorite warrior and adviser of Hrothgar’s, and consumes him, then returns home. In the morning, the warriors follow her tracks to her lake, where they see Aeschere’s head. Beowulf enters the lake, and swims for hours before reaching her cave at the bottom. He fights with Grendel’s mother, but the sword Hrunting, which Unferth lent to Beowulf in a sign of fellowship, fails for the first time. From the treasure hoard in the cave Beowulf seizes a sword forged long ago by giants and kills Grendel’s mother. He sees Grendel’s body, and removes the head, and takes it and the hilt of the giant’s sword (the blade melted on contact with the monster’s blood) back to Hrothgar. 
There is another celebration in Heorot with more gifts and promises of friendship. Hrothgar says he feels like Beowulf is his son, and weeps at Beowulf’s departure. Beowulf and his men return to the land of the Geats, where his uncle the king, Hygelac, and Hygelac’s queen Hygd, greet Beowulf, accepting the treasure Beowulf gives them, and in turn rewarding Beowulf with a sword, praise, and land. Hygelac is eventually killed by the Swedes; his son Heardred, though young, takes the throne with Beowulf’s support. At Heardred’s death, Beowulf takes the throne of the Geats, and rules in great prosperity and fame for fifty years. 
 In Beowulf’s old age, a thief finds a passageway into an old barrow. Inside, a dragon guards a treasure trove left there long ago by the last survivor of an extinct people. The thief steals a cup, but the dragon discovers the theft and burns the land, including Beowulf’s mead-hall. Beowulf, knowing his death is near, decides to fight the dragon. Accompanied by his kinsman Wiglaf, ten warriors, and the thief, Beowulf sets out to confront the dragon. But when Beowulf and the dragon fight, all of Beowulf’s men flee except Wiglaf. With Wiglaf’s help Beowulf kills the dragon, but not before he himself is terribly wounded.
 Before he dies, Beowulf tells Wiglaf to rule after him, and to build him a funeral barrow that overlooks the sea. Wiglaf chastises the men for abandoning their lord. A messenger sent to tell the Geats of Beowulf’s death also warns of hard times for the Geats, now that Beowulf is dead. The Geats build a pyre and cremate Beowulf, then construct a barrow overlooking the sea, burying the dragon’s cursed treasure with him."</a>

Projects approved under Duterte breach P3 trillion, buoy recovery hope
The New Clark City, which spans 9,450 hectares, is being hailed as the country's first smart, green, and resilient metropolis. It is one of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's major initiatives. Israeli companies specializing in providing green technologies and digital applications are among the most recent visitors to New Clark City.
PROJECTS approved by the Duterte administration exceeded P3 trillion as of February 2021, according to data released by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda). Based on Neda Board approvals as of February 2021, approvals reached P3.8 trillion covering 91 infrastructure projects.
At the start of the Duterte administration, the government had aimed to spend P7 trillion to P8 trillion worth of projects to usher in the “golden age of infrastructure.” The top 10 projects approved by the Neda Board had a collective price tag of P2.78 trillion or 72.45 percent of the total approved by the Duterte administration in over four years of the President’s term.
The Unsolicited Proposal for the Bulacan International Airport Scheme, valued at P735.634 billion, is the administration's biggest project. The Department of Transportation will carry that out in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (DOTr).
The Bulacan International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan, is being built, operated, and maintained, and includes airport expansion (including a passenger terminal facility, airside and landside facilities), as well as an 8.4-kilometer tollway connecting to the North Luzon Expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.
The project’s new cost of P628.421 billion and change in scope was approved by the Neda Board; it will be funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) and undertaken by the DOTr. Another big-ticket approval was the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP)-Phase 1, to cost P356.974 billion, to be financed through ODA and also undertaken by the DOTr. The project is a 25.3-km subway, to run from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to FTI in Taguig then to Naia. Its components include civil works; electromechanical, signaling, and telecommunications systems; station facilities; depot facilities; land acquisition; and procurement of rolling stock.</a>

Main organ
Kalayaan (dated January 1896, published March 1896)[3][4]
Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</h2><br />

                            5. Jonathan at David
(Tagalog)
Panganay na anak ni Haring Saul si Jonathan. Isa siyang matapang na mandirigma. Sinabi ni David na mas mabilis pa si Jonathan kaysa sa agila at mas malakas pa kaysa sa leon. Dahil si Jonathan ang panganay na anak ni Saul, siya dapat ang susunod na magiging hari ng Israel. Subalit batid niya na si David ang pinili ni Diyos na susunod na magiging hari. Imbes na mainggit, naging matalik na magkaibigan sina Jonathan at David. Nangako silang poprotektahan at ipagtatanggol nila ang isa’t isa. Ibinigay ni Jonathan kay David ang kaniyang damit, espada, pana, at sinturon bilang tanda o simbolo ng kanilang pagkakaibigan. Noong panahong tumatakas si David kay Saul, pinuntahan siya ni Jonathan at sinabing: ‘Huwag kang matakot. Ikaw ang pinili ni Diyos na maging hari, at batid ’yan ng aking ama.’ Ilang beses ding nanganib ang buhay ni Jonathan dahil sa pagtulong sa kanyang kaibigang si David. Alam niyang gustong patayin ni Haring Saul ang kanyang kaibigan, kaya kinausap niya ang kaniyang ama at sinabi: ‘Magkakasala ka kapag pinatay mo si David; wala naman siyang kasalanan sa iyo.’ Si Haring Saul ay nagalit kay Jonathan. Makalipas ang ilang taon, magkasamang namatay sa digmaan sina Haring Saul at Jonathan. Pumalit sa puwesto ng pagiging hari si David. Hinanap ni Haring David ang anak ni Jonathan na si Mepiboset. Nang magkita sila, sinabi ni David kay Mepiboset: ‘Matalik kong kaibigan ang iyong ama, kaya hindi kita pababayaan. Maninirahan ka sa palasyo ko at kakain sa mesa ko.’ Hindi nalimutan ni Haring David ang kanyag kaibigan at pinagpatuloy ang naging pangako kay Jonathan sa pamamagitan ng kanyang naging anak.
(English)
King Saul's eldest son Jonathan. He was a brave warrior. David said that Jonathan was even faster than the eagle and even stronger than the lion. Since Jonathan was Saul's firstborn son, he was to be the next king of Israel. But he knew that God had chosen David to be the next king. Instead of being jealous, Jonathan and David became close friends. They promised to protect and defend each other. Jonathan gave David his garment, sword, bow, and belt as a sign or symbol of their friendship. When David is fleeing from Saul, Jonathan comes to him and says: 'Do not be afraid. You are the one God has chosen to be king, and my father knows that. ’Jonathan’s life was also in danger several times for helping his friend David. He knew that King Saul wanted to kill his friend, so he spoke to his father and said: ‘You will sin if you kill David; he has not sinned against you. ’King Saul was angry with Jonathan. Some years later, King Saul and Jonathan died together in battle. David succeeds him as king. King David sought out Jonathan's son Mephibosheth. When they meet, David tells Mephibosheth: 'Your father is a close friend of mine, so I will not leave you. You will live in my palace and eat at my table. ’King David did not forget his handsome friend and continued the promise made to Jonathan through his son.

The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</h2><br />

                            15. ano ang tagalog ng "Hrothgar is the King of the Danes in southern Denmark. Through success in battle he has become rich and mighty. As a symbol of his power and prosperity he builds a magnificent mead-hall, called Heorot, in which he and his loyal warriors can feast, drink, boast, and listen to the tales of the scops, the Anglo-Saxon bards. But soon after Heorot is finished, the mirth of the men and the music of the scop anger Grendel, a monster descended from Cain. Grendel raids the hall, snatching men and eating them, then returns to his home in the marsh. He repeats his nightly raids until no one dares sleep in the hall. Heorot, once the symbol of the Scyldings’ greatness, is now a place of shame and terror. This continues for twelve years, until Beowulf, a young warrior of the Geats in southern Sweden, hears about Grendel and, determined to fight the monster, sails to Hrothgar’s lands with fifteen companions.
 Hrothgar, who knew Beowulf’s father Ecgtheow, accepts Beowulf’s offer to fight Grendel and gives him a feast, though Beowulf and Unferth, a warrior loyal to Hrothgar, exchange insults. That night, the warriors sleep in Heorot, with Beowulf keeping watch. Grendel arrives and consumes one of the warriors, then reaches for Beowulf. Beowulf, famous for his powerful grip, which is as strong as the grip of thirty men, struggles with Grendel, tearing off the monster’s shoulder and arm. Grendel returns to the fens to die. His arm is hung as a trophy under the roof of Heorot.
 Hrothgar gives a second feast to celebrate Beowulf’s victory. At the feast, Hrothgar generously rewards Beowulf with treasure. The scop sings again, and Beowulf is praised until nightfall. That night, Grendel’s mother comes to the hall from her home in the bottom of a lake, seeking revenge for the death of her son. She grabs Aeschere, a favorite warrior and adviser of Hrothgar’s, and consumes him, then returns home. In the morning, the warriors follow her tracks to her lake, where they see Aeschere’s head. Beowulf enters the lake, and swims for hours before reaching her cave at the bottom. He fights with Grendel’s mother, but the sword Hrunting, which Unferth lent to Beowulf in a sign of fellowship, fails for the first time. From the treasure hoard in the cave Beowulf seizes a sword forged long ago by giants and kills Grendel’s mother. He sees Grendel’s body, and removes the head, and takes it and the hilt of the giant’s sword (the blade melted on contact with the monster’s blood) back to Hrothgar. 
There is another celebration in Heorot with more gifts and promises of friendship. Hrothgar says he feels like Beowulf is his son, and weeps at Beowulf’s departure. Beowulf and his men return to the land of the Geats, where his uncle the king, Hygelac, and Hygelac’s queen Hygd, greet Beowulf, accepting the treasure Beowulf gives them, and in turn rewarding Beowulf with a sword, praise, and land. Hygelac is eventually killed by the Swedes; his son Heardred, though young, takes the throne with Beowulf’s support. At Heardred’s death, Beowulf takes the throne of the Geats, and rules in great prosperity and fame for fifty years. 
 In Beowulf’s old age, a thief finds a passageway into an old barrow. Inside, a dragon guards a treasure trove left there long ago by the last survivor of an extinct people. The thief steals a cup, but the dragon discovers the theft and burns the land, including Beowulf’s mead-hall. Beowulf, knowing his death is near, decides to fight the dragon. Accompanied by his kinsman Wiglaf, ten warriors, and the thief, Beowulf sets out to confront the dragon. But when Beowulf and the dragon fight, all of Beowulf’s men flee except Wiglaf. With Wiglaf’s help Beowulf kills the dragon, but not before he himself is terribly wounded.
 Before he dies, Beowulf tells Wiglaf to rule after him, and to build him a funeral barrow that overlooks the sea. Wiglaf chastises the men for abandoning their lord. A messenger sent to tell the Geats of Beowulf’s death also warns of hard times for the Geats, now that Beowulf is dead. The Geats build a pyre and cremate Beowulf, then construct a barrow overlooking the sea, burying the dragon’s cursed treasure with him."</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:"Si Hrothgar ang Hari ng mga Danes sa timog ng Denmark. Sa pamamagitan ng tagumpay sa labanan, siya ay naging mayaman at makapangyarihan. Bilang simbolo ng kanyang kapangyarihan at kasaganaan, siya ay nagtatayo ng isang kahanga-hangang mead-hall, na tinatawag na Heorot, kung saan siya at ang kanyang mga tapat na mandirigma Pansin, uminom, ipagmalaki, at pakinggan ang mga tale ng scops, Anglo-Saxon bards. Ngunit sa lalong madaling panahon matapos ang Heorot ay natapos, ang kagalakan ng mga tao at ang musika ng scop ng galit Grendel, isang halimaw ay nagmula mula kay Cain. ang bulwagan, kinuha ang mga lalaki at kumain sa kanila, at pagkatapos ay bumalik sa kanyang bahay sa bana. Inuulit niya ang kanyang mga gabiing pagsalakay hanggang sa walang sinuman ang makatutulog sa bulwagan. Si Heorot, minsan ang simbolo ng kalaking Scyldings, ay isang lugar ng kahihiyan at ito ay nagpapatuloy sa loob ng labindalawang taon, hanggang sa si Beowulf, isang batang mandirigma ng Geats sa timog Sweden, ay nakakarinig tungkol kay Grendel at, determinadong labanan ang halimaw, maglayag sa mga lupain ng Hrothgar na may labinlimang kasama.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Si Hrothgar, na nakakaalam ng ama ni Beowulf na Ecgtheow, ay tumatanggap ng alok ni Beowulf upang labanan si Grendel at binigyan siya ng isang kapistahan, bagama't si Beowulf at Unferth, isang matapat na mandirigma kay Hrothgar, nagbago ng mga insulto. Nang gabing iyon, ang mga mandirigma ay nakatulog sa Heorot, kasama ang Beowulf na nagbabantay. Si Grendel ay dumating at kumakain ng isa sa mga mandirigma, at pagkatapos ay umaabot sa Beowulf. Beowulf, sikat dahil sa kanyang malakas na mahigpit na pagkakahawak, na kasing lakas ng mahigpit na pagkakahawak ng tatlumpung lalaki, nakikipagpunyagi kay Grendel, lumubog sa balikat at braso ng halimaw. Nagbalik si Grendel sa fens upang mamatay. Ang kanyang bisig ay nakabitin bilang tropeo sa ilalim ng bubong ng Heorot.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Si Hrothgar ay nagbibigay ng pangalawang kapistahan upang ipagdiwang ang tagumpay ni Beowulf. Sa kapistahan, binigyan ni Hrothgar ng gantimpala ang Beowulf ng kayamanan. Ang scoping sings muli, at Beowulf ay praised hanggang sa takipsilim. Nang gabing iyon, ang ina ni Grendel ay dumating sa bulwagan mula sa kanyang bahay sa ilalim ng isang lawa, naghahangad ng paghihiganti para sa pagkamatay ng kanyang anak. Kinuha niya ang Aeschere, isang paboritong mandirigma at tagapayo ni Hrothgar, at kumakain sa kanya, pagkatapos ay bumalik sa bahay. Sa umaga, sinundan ng mga mandirigma ang kanyang mga track sa kanyang lawa, kung saan nakikita nila ang ulo ni Aeschere. Ang Beowulf ay pumasok sa lawa, at lumalangoy nang ilang oras bago maabot ang kanyang yungib sa ibaba. Siya ay nakikipaglaban sa ina ni Grendel, ngunit ang tabak na Hrunting, na Unferth lent sa Beowulf sa isang tanda ng pagsasama, ay nabigo sa unang pagkakataon. Mula sa hoard ng kayamanan sa yungib Beowulf ay sinamsam ang isang tabak na pinanghawakan ng mga higante at pinatay ang ina ni Grendel. Nakikita niya ang katawan ni Grendel, at inaalis ang ulo, at kinuha ito at ang sibat ng higanteng tabak (ang talim na natunaw sa pakikipag-ugnay sa dugo ng halimaw) pabalik sa Hrothgar.</strong></p><p></p><br />

Projects approved under Duterte breach P3 trillion, buoy recovery hope
The New Clark City, which spans 9,450 hectares, is being hailed as the country's first smart, green, and resilient metropolis. It is one of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's major initiatives. Israeli companies specializing in providing green technologies and digital applications are among the most recent visitors to New Clark City.
PROJECTS approved by the Duterte administration exceeded P3 trillion as of February 2021, according to data released by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda). Based on Neda Board approvals as of February 2021, approvals reached P3.8 trillion covering 91 infrastructure projects.
At the start of the Duterte administration, the government had aimed to spend P7 trillion to P8 trillion worth of projects to usher in the “golden age of infrastructure.” The top 10 projects approved by the Neda Board had a collective price tag of P2.78 trillion or 72.45 percent of the total approved by the Duterte administration in over four years of the President’s term.
The Unsolicited Proposal for the Bulacan International Airport Scheme, valued at P735.634 billion, is the administration's biggest project. The Department of Transportation will carry that out in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (DOTr).
The Bulacan International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan, is being built, operated, and maintained, and includes airport expansion (including a passenger terminal facility, airside and landside facilities), as well as an 8.4-kilometer tollway connecting to the North Luzon Expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.
The project’s new cost of P628.421 billion and change in scope was approved by the Neda Board; it will be funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) and undertaken by the DOTr. Another big-ticket approval was the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP)-Phase 1, to cost P356.974 billion, to be financed through ODA and also undertaken by the DOTr.
