Source: es.yourdictionary.com Apple: To the Crazy Ones Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify them or lify them. The only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things. In this excerpt from their short ad manifesto, Apple demonstrates their commitment to people who think differently. They strive to push the status quo and invite imagination and creativity. This call to arms, so to speak, not only inspires but invites everyone to explore their thinking.

THE STORY OF THE TWO TRAVELERS AND THE FARMER A traveler came upon an old wise farmer working his field beside the road. Ready to take a break from his journey, the traveler hailed the countryman, who seemed happy enough to take a break himself, and talk for a moment. "What type of people live in the next town?" asked the traveler. "What were the people like where you've come from?" replied the farmer, answering the question with another question. "They were bad, troublemakers and lazy too. The most selfish people in the world and not one of them is to be trusted. I'm happy to be leaving the crooks, and never want to return." "Is that so?" replied the old farmer. "Well, I'm afraid that you'll find the same type in the next town. Disappointed, the traveler dragged himself on his way, and the farmer returned to his work. Sometime later, another traveler, coming from the same direction, hailed the farmer. "What sort of people live in the next town?" he asked. "What were the people like where you've come from?" replied the farmer once again. "They were some of the best people in the world. They are hardworking, honest and friendly. I'm sorry to be leaving them, but I must continue on in my journey." "Fear not," said the farmer. "You'll find the same sort in the next town."​</a>

Source: es.yourdictionary.com Apple: To the Crazy Ones Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify them or lify them. The only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things. In this excerpt from their short ad manifesto, Apple demonstrates their commitment to people who think differently. They strive to push the status quo and invite imagination and creativity. This call to arms, so to speak, not only inspires but invites everyone to explore their thinking.
