                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the unique bond of marriage we discover the deeper meaning of becoming one flesh. Obviously to become one flesh means to become united physically and sexually, but it is far more than that! It is a symbol of a man and a woman bound and melted together, heart, body, and soul, in mutual giving and total oneness.</p><p></p><p>When husband and wife become one flesh, they are no longer two, but actually one. Their union is the fruit of more than companionship or partnership; it is the deepest intimacy. As Friedrich Nietzsche writes, it is brought about by “the resolve of two to create a unity which is more than those who created it. It is reverence for one another and for the fulfillment of such a resolve.”2</p><br />

Help me this question please QwQ
i really appriciate for who will answer this</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.They arethe same in that most of the reproductive organs of both sexes develop from similar embryonic tissue, meaning they are homologous. Both systems have gonads (male have testes and female have ovaries) that produce gametes (testes produce sperm and ovaries produce egg or ovum) and sex organs.</p><p>2.Sperm then travel through the vas deferens through up the spermatic cord into the pelvic cavity, over the ureter to the prostate behind the bladder. ... Here, the vas deferens joins with the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct, which passes through the prostate and empties into the urethra.</p><p>3.The internal sex organs are the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the foetus. The uterus also produces vaginal and uterine secretions which help the transit of sperm to the Fallopian tubes. The ovaries produce the ova (egg cells)</p><p>4.A menstruation happens because of changes in hormones in the body. Hormones are chemical messengers. The ovaries release the female hormones estrogen and progesterone . These hormones cause the lining of the uterus (or womb) to build up.</p><p>5.Remember, you can get pregnant right after your period, even if you're not yet ovulating. That's because sperm can live up to five days if it's trapped in fertile cervical mucus.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>testes produce sperm while the ovaries collects it</p><p>Penis</p><p>it is the parts of the female reproductive system </p><p>development of the reproductive system </p><p>Yes </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>correct me if im wrong po and paki brainliest answer po thank you</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. </strong><strong>How are the testes similar to the ovaries?</strong></p> They are the same in that most of the reproductive organs of both sexes develop from similar embryonic tissue, both systems have gonads that produce (sperm and egg or ovum) and sex organs. <p></p><p><strong>How are they different?</strong></p>The ovaries are the female gonads. They are responsible for the production of the egg as well as the female steroid hormones, estrogen and progesterone. The testes are the male gonads. They are responsible for production of sperm and the male sex hormone.<p></p><p><strong>2.</strong><strong> Describe the pathway of sperm cell through the male reproductive system and out of the male body?</strong></p>The testes are where sperm are manufactured in the scrotum. ... When ejaculation occurs, sperm is forcefully expelled from the tail of the epididymis into the deferent duct. Sperm then travels through the deferent duct through up the spermatic cord into the pelvic cavity, over the ureter to the prostate behind the bladder.<p></p><p><strong>3.</strong><strong> Describe the relationship between the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina.</strong></p>The vagina is attached to the uterus through the cervix, while the uterus is attached to the ovaries via the fallopian tubes. At certain intervals, the ovaries release an ovum, which passes through the fallopian tube into the uterus.<p></p><p>4.<strong> What causes Menstruation?</strong></p>A period happens because of changes in hormones in the body. Hormones are chemical messengers. The ovaries release the female hormones estrogen and progesterone . These hormones cause the lining of the uterus (or womb) to build up.<p></p><p>5.<strong> Can a woman become pregnant at any time of the month?</strong></p>Yes, although it's not very likely. If you have sex without using contraception, you can conceive (get pregnant) at any time during your menstrual cycle, even during or just after your period.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
