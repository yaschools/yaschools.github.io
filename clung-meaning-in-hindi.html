Read the following short story and answer the questions that follow.The Real Princess (The Princess  and the Pea)By Hans Christian Andersen There was once a Prince who wished to marry a  Princess; but then she must be a real Princess. He traveled all over the  world in hopes of finding such a lady; but there was always something wrong.  Princesses he found in plenty; but whether they were real Princesses it was  impossible for him to decide, for now one thing, now another, seemed to him  not quite right about the ladies. At last he returned to his palace quite  cast down, because he wished so much to have a real Princess for his wife. One evening a fearful tempest arose, it thundered  and lightened, and the rain poured down from the sky in torrents: besides, it  was as dark as pitch. All at once there was heard a violent knocking at the  door, and the old King, the Prince's father, went out himself to open it.It was a Princess who was standing outside the  door. What with the rain and the wind, she was in a sad condition; the water  trickled down from her hair, and her clothes clung to her body. She said she  was a real Princess. "Ah! we shall soon see that!" thought  the old Queen-mother; however, she said not a word of what she was going to  do; but went quietly into the bedroom, took all the bed-clothes off the bed,  and put three little peas on the bedstead. She then laid twenty mattresses  one upon another over the three peas, and put twenty feather beds over the  mattresses. Upon this bed the Princess was to pass the night.  The next morning she was asked how she had slept. "Oh, very badly  indeed!" she replied. "I have scarcely closed my eyes the whole night  through. I do not know what was in my bed, but I had something hard under me,  and am all over black and blue. It has hurt me so much!" Now it was plain that the lady must be a real  Princess, since she had been able to feel the three little peas through the  twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds. None but a real Princess could  have had such a delicate sense of feeling. The Prince accordingly made her his wife; being  now convinced that he had found a real Princess. The three peas were however  put into the cabinet of curiosities, where they are still to be seen,  provided they are not lost. Wasn't this a lady of real delicacy?1. What is the setting of the short story?2. Who are the characters in the story? Describe each of these characters.3. What kind of problem did the main character deal with?4. How did the story end? Briefly describe the beginning and middle parts of the story.5. In what way can this short story be relevant to your life right now? Cite two situations and expound on each.​</a>

When he revived, he waslying in the hot sun on the middle of a gardenpath, very bedraggled indeed, and a small boyand his mother were standing over him.3 “Let’s take him in and dry him,” said the mother.4 They took him into the house, and wrapped himin a cloth, and warmed him over a little fire, andhe opened his eyes and sneezed.5 “Now,” said the father, “don’t frighten him, andwe’ll see what he’ll do.”6 It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten amongoose, because he is eaten up from nose totail with curiosity. The motto of all the mongoosefamily is “Run and find out,” and Rikki-tikki wasa true mongoose. He looked at the cloth, decidedthat it was not good to eat, ran all round thetable, sat up and put his fur in order, scratchedhimself, and jumped on the small boy’s shoulder.7 “Don’t be frightened, Teddy,” said his father.“That’s his way of making friends.”8 “Ouch! He’s tickling under my chin,” said Teddy.9 Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy’s collarand neck, snuffed at his ear, and climbed down tothe floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.10 “Good gracious,” said Teddy’s mother, “and that’sa wild creature! I suppose he’s so tame becausewe’ve been kind to him.”1. _________________________________________________________________________2. _________________________________________________________________________3. _________________________________________________________________________4. _________________________________________________________________________5. _________________________________________________________________________Please Help Mee​</a>

When he revived, he waslying in the hot sun on the middle of a gardenpath, very bedraggled indeed, and a small boyand his mother were standing over him.3 “Let’s take him in and dry him,” said the mother.4 They took him into the house, and wrapped himin a cloth, and warmed him over a little fire, andhe opened his eyes and sneezed.5 “Now,” said the father, “don’t frighten him, andwe’ll see what he’ll do.”6 It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten amongoose, because he is eaten up from nose totail with curiosity. The motto of all the mongoosefamily is “Run and find out,” and Rikki-tikki wasa true mongoose. He looked at the cloth, decidedthat it was not good to eat, ran all round thetable, sat up and put his fur in order, scratchedhimself, and jumped on the small boy’s shoulder.7 “Don’t be frightened, Teddy,” said his father.“That’s his way of making friends.”8 “Ouch! He’s tickling under my chin,” said Teddy.9 Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy’s collarand neck, snuffed at his ear, and climbed down tothe floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.10 “Good gracious,” said Teddy’s mother, “and that’sa wild creature! I suppose he’s so tame becausewe’ve been kind to him.”​</a>

Read the following short story and answer the questions that follow.The Real Princess (The Princess  and the Pea)By Hans Christian Andersen There was once a Prince who wished to marry a  Princess; but then she must be a real Princess. He traveled all over the  world in hopes of finding such a lady; but there was always something wrong.  Princesses he found in plenty; but whether they were real Princesses it was  impossible for him to decide, for now one thing, now another, seemed to him  not quite right about the ladies. At last he returned to his palace quite  cast down, because he wished so much to have a real Princess for his wife. One evening a fearful tempest arose, it thundered  and lightened, and the rain poured down from the sky in torrents: besides, it  was as dark as pitch. All at once there was heard a violent knocking at the  door, and the old King, the Prince's father, went out himself to open it.It was a Princess who was standing outside the  door. What with the rain and the wind, she was in a sad condition; the water  trickled down from her hair, and her clothes clung to her body. She said she  was a real Princess. "Ah! we shall soon see that!" thought  the old Queen-mother; however, she said not a word of what she was going to  do; but went quietly into the bedroom, took all the bed-clothes off the bed,  and put three little peas on the bedstead. She then laid twenty mattresses  one upon another over the three peas, and put twenty feather beds over the  mattresses. Upon this bed the Princess was to pass the night.  The next morning she was asked how she had slept. "Oh, very badly  indeed!" she replied. "I have scarcely closed my eyes the whole night  through. I do not know what was in my bed, but I had something hard under me,  and am all over black and blue. It has hurt me so much!" Now it was plain that the lady must be a real  Princess, since she had been able to feel the three little peas through the  twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds. None but a real Princess could  have had such a delicate sense of feeling. The Prince accordingly made her his wife; being  now convinced that he had found a real Princess. The three peas were however  put into the cabinet of curiosities, where they are still to be seen,  provided they are not lost. Wasn't this a lady of real delicacy?1. What is the setting of the short story?2. Who are the characters in the story? Describe each of these characters.3. What kind of problem did the main character deal with?4. How did the story end? Briefly describe the beginning and middle parts of the story.5. In what way can this short story be relevant to your life right now? Cite two situations and expound on each.​</h2><br />

When he revived, he waslying in the hot sun on the middle of a gardenpath, very bedraggled indeed, and a small boyand his mother were standing over him.3 “Let’s take him in and dry him,” said the mother.4 They took him into the house, and wrapped himin a cloth, and warmed him over a little fire, andhe opened his eyes and sneezed.5 “Now,” said the father, “don’t frighten him, andwe’ll see what he’ll do.”6 It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten amongoose, because he is eaten up from nose totail with curiosity. The motto of all the mongoosefamily is “Run and find out,” and Rikki-tikki wasa true mongoose. He looked at the cloth, decidedthat it was not good to eat, ran all round thetable, sat up and put his fur in order, scratchedhimself, and jumped on the small boy’s shoulder.7 “Don’t be frightened, Teddy,” said his father.“That’s his way of making friends.”8 “Ouch! He’s tickling under my chin,” said Teddy.9 Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy’s collarand neck, snuffed at his ear, and climbed down tothe floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.10 “Good gracious,” said Teddy’s mother, “and that’sa wild creature! I suppose he’s so tame becausewe’ve been kind to him.”1. _________________________________________________________________________2. _________________________________________________________________________3. _________________________________________________________________________4. _________________________________________________________________________5. _________________________________________________________________________Please Help Mee​</h2><br />

                            25. Pick Out at least five figurative language from the poem below.Excerpt adapted from“Rikki-tikki-tavi”by Rudyard Kipling  1 Rikki-tikki-tavi was amongoose, rather like a littlecat in his fur and his tail, butquite like a weasel in his headand his habits.2 One day, a flood washedRikki-tikki out of the burrowwhere he lived with hisfamily, and carried him away.He found a floating wisp of grass, and clung toit till he lost his senses. When he revived, he waslying in the hot sun on the middle of a gardenpath, very bedraggled indeed, and a small boyand his mother were standing over him.3 “Let’s take him in and dry him,” said the mother.4 They took him into the house, and wrapped himin a cloth, and warmed him over a little fire, andhe opened his eyes and sneezed.5 “Now,” said the father, “don’t frighten him, andwe’ll see what he’ll do.”6 It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten amongoose, because he is eaten up from nose totail with curiosity. The motto of all the mongoosefamily is “Run and find out,” and Rikki-tikki wasa true mongoose. He looked at the cloth, decidedthat it was not good to eat, ran all round thetable, sat up and put his fur in order, scratchedhimself, and jumped on the small boy’s shoulder.7 “Don’t be frightened, Teddy,” said his father.“That’s his way of making friends.”8 “Ouch! He’s tickling under my chin,” said Teddy.9 Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy’s collarand neck, snuffed at his ear, and climbed down tothe floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.10 “Good gracious,” said Teddy’s mother, “and that’sa wild creature! I suppose he’s so tame becausewe’ve been kind to him.”​</h2><br />
