                                            would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</a>

                                            Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</a>

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</a>

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </a>

                                            What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</a>

                                            Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</a>

When I was a boy, one of the rules at home that II did not like at all was to be made to lie on the bare floor of our sala after lunch. I usually lay side by side with two other children in the family. We were forced to sleep by my mother. She watched us as she darned old dresses, read an awit, or hummed a cradle song in Tagalog."

Indeed, during the Spanish times, the Philippines was the land of the fiesta, the novena, and the siesta." (Siesta, Leopoldo R. Serrano) 48.

How can you make others happy in your own way?_______________________________The Happiest Boy in the Worldby: NVM GonzalezJulio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to goto school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had leftTablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schoolingfor a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him astenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to bevisiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call eachother compadre."Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece ofpaper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to themunicipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to hisgreat surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talkedwith the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was surethat he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso."It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He'sin the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, Ithought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little wayacross stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempenmosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaosthat he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barokriver, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, likea tired youth; but he was only twelve.The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, offish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floorseemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, ifJulio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blowthen; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then hecontinued with his letter."This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only lethim stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished youcould almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was aservant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt whichyour feet had left on the floor."I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best tophrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard hisletter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.​</a>

Being naturally lazy andimpatient, he did not like the work of pounding nce.One day, Daskol had to pound a preater quantity of palay than wuel He wasirritated because every time he raised the pestle hugher, and every time it hit the sky,the sky would be raised in his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising,When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky hadrisen and it is where it is today(Dolo)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman One day,they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting But because the boneswere very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bonesThe woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky Butwhenever she pounded, she would hit the sky.

Because of this close connectionbetween God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need toworkWhenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their requestwas made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam andEve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came thecustom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came toenjoy it.

                                             pa tagalog plsss Japanese management once attracted global attention It was very difficult for Westerners to understand why employees work so hard for a company. Many observers concluded that Japan must have had some magical 1 t 3 management system. But they were wrong. The Japanese work force has been rooted in a tradition that values diligence. The reason some Japanese enterprises excel is that their employees share this set of values and work hard for the company. In the next decade the new generation, which grew up in more affluent times, will form the majority in the work force, and individualism will come to the forefront. The decline of Japanese companies could thus begin if excessive individualism leads their people to lose 2 appreciation for the value of work. In the United States today, companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which advocates corporate ideals and philosophy, continue to prosper. No company should rely solely on employees' native diligence or traditional values to succeed. We must set forth a company philosophy for our young employees, share with them the real meaning of work, and give them a purpose in life.​</a>

                                            - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

EARLY PHILIPPINE LITERATURE (an excerpt) by Dr. Lilla Quindoza-Santiago The early inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had a native alphabet or syllabory which among the Tagalogs was called baybayin, an inscription akin to Sanskrit. It was through the baybayin that literary forms such as songs, riddles and proverbs, lyric and short poems as well as parts of epic poems were written. The bulk of these early literature however was just passed on through oral recitation and Incantation and were transcribed into the Roman alphabet only centuries later by Spanish chroniclers and other scholars. It is believed that replacement of the baybayin by the Roman alphabet must have obliterated a significant aspect of indigenous Philippine literature. 1. The excerpt above is an example of a/an... A.

Julio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,
ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to go
to school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had left
Tablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schooling
for a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him as
tenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to be
visiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call each
other compadre.
"Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece of
paper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,
he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the
municipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to his
great surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talked
with the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was sure
that he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso.
"It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He's
in the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, I
thought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."
He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,
the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little way
across stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempen
mosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaos
that he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barok
river, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, like
a tired youth; but he was only twelve.
The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, of
fish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floor
seemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, if
Julio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blow
then; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,
and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then he
continued with his letter.
"This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only let
him stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.
He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."
Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.
he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished you
could almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was a
servant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt which
your feet had left on the floor.
"I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best to
phrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard his
letter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.</a>

                                            - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

                            4. would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</h2><br />

                            7. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</h2><br />

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</h2><br />

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </h2><br />

Naglakad-lakad siya hanggang sa marating niya ang lugar kung saan sinalubong ng langit ang dagat Maganda</p><p>at hindi pangkaraniwang tanawin ang sumalubong sa kanyang mga mata.</p><p>Habang hinahangaan niya ang mga magagandang bagay sa paligid, isang boses ang bumulaga sa kanya. Nagtanong ito, “Saan ka pupunta</p><p>galing sa pinaka maganda?" Paglingon niya ay nakita niya ang isang binata na kamukha ng kanyang ama</p><p>mas patas. Gusto niyang tumakas, ngunit nang muli siyang tumingin sa kanya, nakita niyang nakangiti ito sa kanya. Pagkuha</p><p>lakas ng loob niyang sumagot, "Ako si Luna, anak ng diyos ng araw." Ngumiti sa kanya ang binata at sumagot, “I</p><p>Ako si Mar, ang anak ng diyos ng dagat. Maligayang pagdating sa aming kaharian." Hindi nagtagal ay naging matalik na magkaibigan ang dalawa. Marami silang kawili-wiling kwento na sasabihin. Kapag oras na para sa</p><p>Luna to go, nangakong magkikita sila nang madalas hangga't maaari, dahil marami pa silang kwento sila</p><p>Nagpatuloy ang pagkikita sa iisang lugar hanggang sa napagtanto nilang in love na sila sa isa't isa.</p><p>Isang araw pagkatapos ng isa sa kanilang mga lihim na pagkikita, bumalik si Luna sa langit na puno ng kagalakan. Siya ay gayon</p><p>masaya na sinabi niya ang sikreto niya sa isa niyang pinsan. Ang pinsan, naninibugho sa kanyang kagandahan at kanyang kaligayahan, iniulat ang relasyon sa diyos ng araw. Nagalit ang diyos ng araw sa pagsuway ng kanyang anak sa imortal</p><p>mga batas. Isinara niya siya sa kanilang hardin at hindi siya pinayagang makalabas. Pagkatapos ay umuwi siyang malungkot. Sa tuwing naaalala niya si Mar, nagmamadali siyang lumabas sa ginto</p><p>kalesa patungo sa tagpuan sa pag-asang makita siyang muli. Ang mga mangingisda sa labas ng dagat ay naniniwala na sa bawat oras</p><p>Lumilitaw si Luna, ang buwan, nagugulo ang dagat. Si Mar ang sumusubok na tumakas sa kanyang kweba,” sabi nila.</p><br />

                            10. What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</h2><br />

                            12. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</h2><br />

When I was a boy, one of the rules at home that II did not like at all was to be made to lie on the bare floor of our sala after lunch. I usually lay side by side with two other children in the family. We were forced to sleep by my mother. She watched us as she darned old dresses, read an awit, or hummed a cradle song in Tagalog."

Indeed, during the Spanish times, the Philippines was the land of the fiesta, the novena, and the siesta." (Siesta, Leopoldo R. Serrano) 48.

Why and why not?_________________________________________________________________________5. How can you make others happy in your own way?_______________________________The Happiest Boy in the Worldby: NVM GonzalezJulio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to goto school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had leftTablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schoolingfor a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him astenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to bevisiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call eachother compadre."Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece ofpaper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to themunicipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to hisgreat surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talkedwith the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was surethat he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso."It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He'sin the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, Ithought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little wayacross stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempenmosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaosthat he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barokriver, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, likea tired youth; but he was only twelve.The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, offish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floorseemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, ifJulio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blowthen; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then hecontinued with his letter."This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only lethim stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished youcould almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was aservant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt whichyour feet had left on the floor."I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best tophrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard hisletter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.​</h2><br />

                            17. read it allWhy the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​</h2><br />

                            21.  pa tagalog plsss Japanese management once attracted global attention It was very difficult for Westerners to understand why employees work so hard for a company. Many observers concluded that Japan must have had some magical 1 t 3 management system. But they were wrong. The Japanese work force has been rooted in a tradition that values diligence. The reason some Japanese enterprises excel is that their employees share this set of values and work hard for the company. In the next decade the new generation, which grew up in more affluent times, will form the majority in the work force, and individualism will come to the forefront. The decline of Japanese companies could thus begin if excessive individualism leads their people to lose 2 appreciation for the value of work. In the United States today, companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which advocates corporate ideals and philosophy, continue to prosper. No company should rely solely on employees' native diligence or traditional values to succeed. We must set forth a company philosophy for our young employees, share with them the real meaning of work, and give them a purpose in life.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang pamamahala ng Hapon ay minsang nakaakit ng pandaigdigang atensyon Napakahirap para sa mga Kanluranin na maunawaan kung bakit ang mga empleyado ay nagtatrabaho nang husto para sa isang kumpanya. Napagpasyahan ng maraming tagamasid na ang Japan ay may ilang mahiwagang 1 t 3 na sistema ng pamamahala. Ngunit nagkamali sila. Nag-ugat ang Japanese work force sa isang tradisyon na pinahahalagahan ang kasipagan. Ang dahilan kung bakit napakahusay ng ilang negosyo sa Japan ay dahil ang kanilang mga empleyado ay nagbabahagi ng hanay ng mga halagang ito at nagsusumikap para sa kumpanya. Sa susunod na dekada, ang bagong henerasyon, na lumaki sa mas mayayamang panahon, ay bubuo ng karamihan sa lakas ng trabaho, at ang indibidwalismo ay mauuna. Ang pagbaba ng mga kumpanyang Hapones ay maaaring magsimula kung ang labis na indibidwalismo ay humantong sa kanilang mga tao na mawalan ng pagpapahalaga sa halaga ng trabaho. Sa Estados Unidos ngayon, ang mga kumpanyang tulad ng Hewlett-Packard at IBM, na nagtataguyod ng mga ideyal at pilosopiya ng korporasyon, ay patuloy na umuunlad. Walang kumpanyang dapat umasa lamang sa katutubong kasipagan o tradisyonal na pagpapahalaga ng mga empleyado upang magtagumpay. Dapat tayong magtakda ng pilosopiya ng kumpanya para sa ating mga kabataang empleyado, ibahagi sa kanila ang tunay na kahulugan ng trabaho, at bigyan sila ng layunin sa buhay.</p><br />

                            22. - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

                            23. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the 
woman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation.

EARLY PHILIPPINE LITERATURE (an excerpt) by Dr. Lilla Quindoza-Santiago The early inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had a native alphabet or syllabory which among the Tagalogs was called baybayin, an inscription akin to Sanskrit. It was through the baybayin that literary forms such as songs, riddles and proverbs, lyric and short poems as well as parts of epic poems were written. The bulk of these early literature however was just passed on through oral recitation and Incantation and were transcribed into the Roman alphabet only centuries later by Spanish chroniclers and other scholars.

The Happiest Boy in the World
by: NVM Gonzalez
Julio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,
ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to go
to school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had left
Tablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schooling
for a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him as
tenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to be
visiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call each
other compadre.
"Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece of
paper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,
he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the
municipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to his
great surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talked
with the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was sure
that he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso.
"It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He's
in the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, I
thought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."
He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,
the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little way
across stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempen
mosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaos
that he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barok
river, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, like
a tired youth; but he was only twelve.
The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, of
fish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floor
seemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, if
Julio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blow
then; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,
and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then he
continued with his letter.
"This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only let
him stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.
He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."
Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.
he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished you
could almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was a
servant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt which
your feet had left on the floor.
"I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best to
phrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard his
letter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.</h2><br />

                            30. - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.
