                                            Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</a>

Last time more peaceful, not so much taximen, or so much cars and buses.3 Yes madam, can make a living. So so. What to do. Must work hard if wants to success in Singapore. People like us, no education, no capital for business, we must sweat to earn money for wife and children.Yes, madam, quite big family--eight children, six sons, two daughters. Big family! Ha! Ha! No good, madam. In those days. Where got Family Planning in Singapore? People born many, many children, every year, one child. Is no good at all. Today is much better.

My eldest daughter, she is twenty plus, stay at home, help the mother. No, not married yet---Very shy and her health not so good, but a good, and obedient girl. My other girl Oh, Madam! Very hard for father when daughter is no good and go against her parents. Very sad like punishment from God. Today, young people not like us when we are young. We obey. Our parents say don't do this, we never do. Otherwise, the cane. My father cane me. I was big enough to be married, and still, got caning. My father he was very strict, and that is good thing for parents to be strict. If not, young boys and girls become very useless. Do not want to study, but run away, and go to night clubs and take drugs and make love. You agree with me madam?6 Today, young people they are very trouble to their parents. Madam, you see this young people over there, outside the coffee house? See what I mean, madam? They are only school boys and school girls, but they act like big shots,Quarter 2 Week 5pending money, smoking, wearing latest fashion, and making love. Ah, Madam, I know, I know! As taximan, I know them and their habits. Madam, you are a teacher, you say? You know or not that young school girls, fifteen, sixteen years old, they go to public lavatory or hotel and change into these clothes, and they put make-up on their face. Their parents never know. They tell their Mum got school meeting, got sports and games, this, that, but they really come out and play the fool.​</a>

The story: 
The Adventures of Juan
Juan was always getting into trouble. He was a lazy boy, and more than that, he did not have good sense. When he tried to do things, he made such dreadful mistakes that he might better not have tried.
His family grew very impatient with him, scolding and beating him whenever he did anything wrong. One day his mother, who was almost discouraged with him, gave him a bolo[1] and sent him to the forest, for she thought he could at least cut firewood. Juan walked leisurely along, contemplating some means of escape. At last he came to a tree that seemed easy to cut, and then he drew his long knife and prepared to work.
Now it happened that this was a magic tree and it said to Juan:
"If you do not cut me I will give you a goat that shakes silver from its whiskers."
This pleased Juan wonderfully, both because he was curious to see the goat, and because he would not have to chop the wood. He agreed at once to spare the tree, whereupon the bark separated and a goat stepped out. Juan commanded it to shake its whiskers, and when the money began to drop he was so delighted that he took the animal and started home to show his treasure to his mother.
On the way he met a friend who was more cunning than Juan, and when he heard of the boy's rich goat he decided to rob him. Knowing Juan's fondness for tuba[2] he persuaded him to drink, and while he was drunk, the friend substituted another goat for the magic one. As soon as he was sober again, Juan hastened home with the goat and told his people of the wonderful tree, but when he commanded the animal to shake its whiskers, no money fell out. The family, believing it to be another of Juan's tricks, beat and scolded the poor boy.
The went back to the tree and threatened to cut it down for lying to him, but the tree said :
"No, do not cut me down and I will give you a not which you may cast on dry ground, or even in the tree tops, and it will return full of fish."
So Juan spared the tree and started home with his precious net, but on the way he met the same friend who again persuaded him to drink tuba. While he was drunk, the friend replaced the magic net with a common one, so that when Juan reached home and tried to show his power, he was again the subject of ridicule.
Once more Juan went to his tree, this time determined to cut it down. But the offer of a magic pot, always full of rice and spoons which provided wbatever he wished to eat with his rice, dissuaded him, and he started home happier than ever. Before reaching home, however, he met with the same fate as before, and his folks, who were becoming tired of his pranks, beat him harder than ever.
Thoroughly angered, Juan sought the tree a fourth time and was on the point of cutting it down when once more it arrested his attention. After some discussion, he consented to accept a stick to which he had only to say, "Boombye, Boomba," and it would beat and kill anything he wished.
When he met his friend on this trip, he was asked what he had and he replied:
"Oh, it is only a stick, but if I say 'Boombye, Boomba' it will beat you to death."
At the sound of the magic words the stick leaped from his hands and began beating his friend until he cried:
"Oh, stop it and I will give back everything that I stole from you." Juan ordered the stick to stop, and then he compelled the man to lead the goat and to carry the net and the jar and spoons to his home.
There Juan commanded the goat, and it shook its whiskers until his mother and brothers had all the silver they could carry. Then they ate from the magic jar and spoons until they were filled. And this time Juan was not scolded. After they had finished Juan said:
"You have beaten me and scolded me all my life, and now you are glad to accept my good things. I am going to show you something else: "Boombye, Boomba'." Immediately the stick leaped out and beat them all until they begged for mercy and promised that Juan should ever after be head of the house.
From that time Juan was rich and powerful, but he never went anywhere without his stick. One night, when some thieves came to his house, he would have been robbed and killed had it not been for the magic words "Boombye, Boomba," which caused the death of all the robbers.
Some time after this he married a beautiful princess, and because of the kindness of the magic tree they always lived happily.[3]</a>

                                            The Man Who Can't Be Move
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

Discourse
Directions: Read and understand the song. Then, answer the questions in the chart. (5 points)
Going back to the corner where I first saw you Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand I'm not broke I'm just a broken hearted man
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do How can I move on when I'm still in love with you
Chorus:
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving Policeman says son you can't stay here
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go
Repeat Chorus
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving. I'm not moving, I'm not moving People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl, oh whoa There are no holes in his shoes But a big hole in his world
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved. I'm the man who can't be moved
Repeat Chorus 2x
Going back to the corner where I first saw you. Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move.

"I will turn you into an ugly black rabbit for being such a mean and bad mannered person. Poof! the prince instantly turned into a black rabbit. "Only when someone takes pity and sheds a tear for you will the spell be broken." On the other side of the kingdom there was a river and on its riverbank was the house of a beautiful girl named Felicia. She was a beautiful and kindhearted girl.

                                            Hating Kapatid By: Raissa Rivera Falgui Hating Kapatid My big brother and I come home from school together. A delicious snack always awaits us at home. Today, it's Bibingka that Nanay bought for us Yummy! Nanay kissed us and told us to sit down." You're in charge of dividing the food", she told my brother, "and remember share like brother and sister." The bibingka was cut into four. My brother got three pieces while I got one. "I'm bigger and hungrier. I need more food." He's really bigger than me so I didn't say anything Once, Nanay made fried bananas I helped her cut four bananas in half before she cooked them, so there were eight pieces. My brother got six. "This is how to share like brother and sister", he told me The same thing happened when Tatay brought home our favorite buko pie. When Nanay made a cake and when we had a dozen little rice cakes for our meryenda if someone gave us a mountain of candy, I bet I would only get two or three pieces. My classmate Dina is better off. She has no brothers or sisters. She doesn't have to share anything. If she wanted to. she could eat a whole bibingka or buko pie or cake! But one day, Dina had nothing to eat. She forgot her food at home. "Would you like half of my sandwich?" I offered. I divided it carefully and gave her half. "You did that so carefully. It looks like we are sharing like sisters"." Oh no, both halves are exactly the same," I said. I don't think Dina knows how brothers and sisters share. After all, she doesn't have any. Once, Dina invited me to her house "I have no one to play with at home", she said. We had fun playing hopscotch in front of her house. When her daddy come, he had mamon with him. "Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest. The two of you can just share it." He said. "You divide it. Let's share it like sisters." Dina said. I think she doesn't know how sisters are supposed to share! But how do we do it? We are the same age. We are the same height (she's just a little bit chubbier). "Let's not share like sister" I said. "We're friends. Let's share like friends. "Dina laughed. "What do you mean? Here, let's just do this. You divide it, and I'll choose which half I want. "My hands shook as I carefully divided the mamon in half. Dina looked at the pieces. "It looks like they are the same. So, sharing like sisters is the same as sharing like friends." Then her mommy came home. "Have you had your meryenda?" she asked as she brought out her present-sapin sapin! I had to go home already, so she put sapin-sapin in a small bilao and gave it to me. Tatay was not yet home when I arrived. Nanay was cooking dinner. My brother looked hungry because he was waiting at the dining table. I placed the sapin-sapin in the middle of the table. "Let's share," I said. I got a knife and cut the sapin-sapin in half. Then I cut in half again. "Here, Kuya" I said and gave him one piece. "My friend Dina told me that's how brother and sister are supposed to share. "His eyes grew round, and his face turned red. "Your friend is right, that's how brother and sister are supposed to share," he said in a small voice. I felt like I was bigger and older than my brother. "Maybe we should just share like family," I said. I set aside one piece. "This is for Nanay. "And this is for Tatay" he said. I felt happy because everyone got to try sapin-sapin. It made me happy to make my family happy.​</a>

Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</h2><br />

he would still have experienced the same comforts had he

The story: 
The Adventures of Juan
Juan was always getting into trouble. He was a lazy boy, and more than that, he did not have good sense. When he tried to do things, he made such dreadful mistakes that he might better not have tried.
His family grew very impatient with him, scolding and beating him whenever he did anything wrong. One day his mother, who was almost discouraged with him, gave him a bolo[1] and sent him to the forest, for she thought he could at least cut firewood. Juan walked leisurely along, contemplating some means of escape. At last he came to a tree that seemed easy to cut, and then he drew his long knife and prepared to work.
Now it happened that this was a magic tree and it said to Juan:
"If you do not cut me I will give you a goat that shakes silver from its whiskers."
This pleased Juan wonderfully, both because he was curious to see the goat, and because he would not have to chop the wood. He agreed at once to spare the tree, whereupon the bark separated and a goat stepped out. Juan commanded it to shake its whiskers, and when the money began to drop he was so delighted that he took the animal and started home to show his treasure to his mother.
On the way he met a friend who was more cunning than Juan, and when he heard of the boy's rich goat he decided to rob him. Knowing Juan's fondness for tuba[2] he persuaded him to drink, and while he was drunk, the friend substituted another goat for the magic one. As soon as he was sober again, Juan hastened home with the goat and told his people of the wonderful tree, but when he commanded the animal to shake its whiskers, no money fell out. The family, believing it to be another of Juan's tricks, beat and scolded the poor boy.
The went back to the tree and threatened to cut it down for lying to him, but the tree said :
"No, do not cut me down and I will give you a not which you may cast on dry ground, or even in the tree tops, and it will return full of fish."
So Juan spared the tree and started home with his precious net, but on the way he met the same friend who again persuaded him to drink tuba. While he was drunk, the friend replaced the magic net with a common one, so that when Juan reached home and tried to show his power, he was again the subject of ridicule.
Once more Juan went to his tree, this time determined to cut it down. But the offer of a magic pot, always full of rice and spoons which provided wbatever he wished to eat with his rice, dissuaded him, and he started home happier than ever. Before reaching home, however, he met with the same fate as before, and his folks, who were becoming tired of his pranks, beat him harder than ever.
Thoroughly angered, Juan sought the tree a fourth time and was on the point of cutting it down when once more it arrested his attention. After some discussion, he consented to accept a stick to which he had only to say, "Boombye, Boomba," and it would beat and kill anything he wished.
When he met his friend on this trip, he was asked what he had and he replied:
"Oh, it is only a stick, but if I say 'Boombye, Boomba' it will beat you to death."
At the sound of the magic words the stick leaped from his hands and began beating his friend until he cried:
"Oh, stop it and I will give back everything that I stole from you." Juan ordered the stick to stop, and then he compelled the man to lead the goat and to carry the net and the jar and spoons to his home.
There Juan commanded the goat, and it shook its whiskers until his mother and brothers had all the silver they could carry. Then they ate from the magic jar and spoons until they were filled. And this time Juan was not scolded. After they had finished Juan said:
"You have beaten me and scolded me all my life, and now you are glad to accept my good things. I am going to show you something else: "Boombye, Boomba'." Immediately the stick leaped out and beat them all until they begged for mercy and promised that Juan should ever after be head of the house.
From that time Juan was rich and powerful, but he never went anywhere without his stick. One night, when some thieves came to his house, he would have been robbed and killed had it not been for the magic words "Boombye, Boomba," which caused the death of all the robbers.
Some time after this he married a beautiful princess, and because of the kindness of the magic tree they always lived happily.[3]</h2><br />

                            14. The Man Who Can't Be Move
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

The poor farmer who lived at the bottom of themountain was very upset He dearly loved his mother and the orderof the wicked ruler. So, he tried to find the kindest way to put his mothercaused him great pain. But no one had ever dared to disobey the orderunwhitened rice. This was the main food for people like him and hisAt the end of the day, with his work completed, the farmer took somemother. He cooked it, dried it, and tied it up in a square cloth. He thenswung it in a bundle over his shoulder, along with a pitcher filled withto deathcool water. Next, he lifted his mother onto his back and began to climbthe mountainThe trail up the mountain was long and steep. It was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by hunters and woodcutters. At somepoints, they got lost and confused, but the farmer didn't care. He justkept climbing upwards toward the top of the mountain. This area wasknown as Obatsuyama, which means "abandoning of the aged."The man's mother, traveling on her son's back, noticed that he wasunsure where he was going. He was wandering from one path toanother She was worried that he would get into trouble on his way backdown So, as they travelled, she reached out her hand and snappedbranch twigs. She dropped a handful every w steps to show the waybackFinally, they got to the top of the mountain. The man was tired but hewas also heartbroken at the thought of abandoning his mother He putdown the rice and water and prepared a comfortable place for hismother. He made a soft bed out of fallen pine needles and gently placedhis mother upon it. The man wrapped his mother's padded coat aroundher shoulders. Then, with tears in his eyes and pain in his heart, he saidgoodbyeThe old mother gave a last piece of advice to her son. Her voice wastrembling with unselfish love. She said, "My son, do not let your eyes beblinded the mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and followthe path with piles or wigs on it They will guide you back to the pathyou know lower down the mountain."The son looked back over the path and was surprised to see the pilesof vigs. Then he looked down at the poor, old shriveled hands of hismother. They were scratched and dirty because of the loving work shehad done for him. He bowed down to give her honor and, with his heartbreaking said, "Oh, dear mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I willnot leave you Together wo will follow the path of twigs, and together weOnce again, ho put his mother on his back and set off down themountain. The weight seemed light to him now and he was able to makeit through the shadows and the moonlight down to their little hut. Underthe kitchen floor was a hidden basement where food was stored Theson hid his mother in there. He made sure she had all the food that sheneeded But he was always worried that she would be discovered.Time passed and the son began to feel safe again But then the rulersent out another order. This one was extremely unreasonable Hewanted his people to give him a gift of a rope made of ashesEveryone was in fear. The order had to be obeyed, yet no one in allof Shining knew how to make a rope of ashes. Then, one night, the sontold his mother about the new order from the ruler. Then his motherspoke up."Waitl" she said. "I will think! I will thinki"After two days of thinking, she told him what to do"Make a rope of twisted straw," she said. "Then stretch it upon a rowof flat stones and burn it on a windless night"The son called the people together. They worked together to do justas his mother had said. When the fire died down, lying upon the stoneswas a perfectly shaped rope of ashesWhen the ruler came down, he was very pleased at the clevernessof the farmer and gave him lots of praise. But he also demanded to knowwhere the man's wisdom had come from. The farmer cried out, I cannotliel" Then he went on to tell the ruler his story.The ruler listened carefully then thought for a long time. Finally, helifted his head and said, "Shining needs more than strength and youthI forgot the old saying.

                            28. Hating Kapatid By: Raissa Rivera Falgui Hating Kapatid My big brother and I come home from school together. A delicious snack always awaits us at home. Today, it's Bibingka that Nanay bought for us Yummy! Nanay kissed us and told us to sit down." You're in charge of dividing the food", she told my brother, "and remember share like brother and sister." The bibingka was cut into four. My brother got three pieces while I got one. "I'm bigger and hungrier. I need more food." He's really bigger than me so I didn't say anything Once, Nanay made fried bananas I helped her cut four bananas in half before she cooked them, so there were eight pieces. My brother got six. "This is how to share like brother and sister", he told me The same thing happened when Tatay brought home our favorite buko pie. When Nanay made a cake and when we had a dozen little rice cakes for our meryenda if someone gave us a mountain of candy, I bet I would only get two or three pieces. My classmate Dina is better off. She has no brothers or sisters. She doesn't have to share anything. If she wanted to. she could eat a whole bibingka or buko pie or cake! But one day, Dina had nothing to eat. She forgot her food at home. "Would you like half of my sandwich?" I offered. I divided it carefully and gave her half. "You did that so carefully. It looks like we are sharing like sisters"." Oh no, both halves are exactly the same," I said. I don't think Dina knows how brothers and sisters share. After all, she doesn't have any. Once, Dina invited me to her house "I have no one to play with at home", she said. We had fun playing hopscotch in front of her house. When her daddy come, he had mamon with him. "Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest. The two of you can just share it." He said. "You divide it. Let's share it like sisters." Dina said. I think she doesn't know how sisters are supposed to share! But how do we do it? We are the same age. We are the same height (she's just a little bit chubbier). "Let's not share like sister" I said. "We're friends. Let's share like friends. "Dina laughed. "What do you mean? Here, let's just do this. You divide it, and I'll choose which half I want. "My hands shook as I carefully divided the mamon in half. Dina looked at the pieces. "It looks like they are the same. So, sharing like sisters is the same as sharing like friends." Then her mommy came home. "Have you had your meryenda?" she asked as she brought out her present-sapin sapin! I had to go home already, so she put sapin-sapin in a small bilao and gave it to me. Tatay was not yet home when I arrived. Nanay was cooking dinner. My brother looked hungry because he was waiting at the dining table. I placed the sapin-sapin in the middle of the table. "Let's share," I said. I got a knife and cut the sapin-sapin in half. Then I cut in half again. "Here, Kuya" I said and gave him one piece. "My friend Dina told me that's how brother and sister are supposed to share. "His eyes grew round, and his face turned red. "Your friend is right, that's how brother and sister are supposed to share," he said in a small voice. I felt like I was bigger and older than my brother. "Maybe we should just share like family," I said. I set aside one piece. "This is for Nanay. "And this is for Tatay" he said. I felt happy because everyone got to try sapin-sapin. It made me happy to make my family happy.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story "Hating Kapatid" by Raissa Rivera Falgui is about a young girl who struggles with sharing with her big brother. She feels that her brother always gets more food and treats than she does, and she wishes she didn't have to share with him. However, when she makes a new friend who doesn't have any siblings, she realizes the importance of sharing and being kind to others. She eventually learns to share with her brother and her family, and finds happiness in making others happy.</p><p></p><p>The story highlights the importance of sharing and kindness, especially within families. It also shows how we can learn from others and grow as individuals by being open to new experiences and perspectives.</p><br />
