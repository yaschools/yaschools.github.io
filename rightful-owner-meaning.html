                                            An investigator predicts that dog owners in the country spend more time 
walking their dogs than do dog owners in the city. The investigator gets a sample 
of 21 country owners and 23 city owners. The mean number of hours per week 
that city owners spend walking their dogs is 10.0. The standard deviation of 
hours spent walking the dog by city owners is 3.0. The mean number of hours’ 
country owners spent walking their dogs per week was 15.0. The standard 
deviation of the number of hours spent walking the dog by owners in the country 
was 4.0. Do dog owners in the country spend more time walking their dogs than 
do dog owners in the city?</a>

                        One day, the cow fell ill and stopped giving milk. Thinking she would never recover, Gopal drove her out of his house. “Now my owner does not need me. I will never return to him," thought the sad cow and ran away. On the way, the hungry cow fell unconscious. Dharma, a kind-hearted farmer noticed her and brought her to his house. After a few days the cow recovered. Dharma thought, “I wonder who this cow belongs to." But he was unable to find the owner. Soon, the cow gave birth to a calf and started giving milk again. Dharma fed her well and looked after the calf, too. By selling the cow’s milk, Dharma became a wealthy man. Everyone wanted to buy Dharma’s cow’s milk. The cow’s fame spread everywhere. Gopal too came to know about this event. “I wonder if that cow is the same one I had driven away," thought Gopal. When Gopal went to Dharma’s house, he found that is was indeed his cow. “That cow belongs to me," said Gopal. But Dharma refused to return the cow. “I will take the help of the Village Administration," shouted Gopal. And next day, the Village Administrator heard this case. Immediately, the Village Administration Council assembled. Every one was eager to know what the judgment would be. “Let the cow decide for herself who she want to live with," said the Village Administrator. So the cow was placed between Dharma and Gopal. The cow was asked by the Village Administrator to with the person whom she wanted to live with. The cow walked away from Gopal and started licking Dharma’s hand. She knew the difference between Gopal’s selfishness and Dharma’s kindness. The Village Administrator handed over the cow to the rightful owner, Dharma. <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Pricing is managers’ biggest marketing headache. It’s where they feel the most pressure to perform and the least certain that they are doing a good job. The pressure is intensified because, for the most part, managers believe that they don’t have control over price: It is dictated by the market. Moreover, pricing is often seen as a difficult area in which to set objectives and measure results. Ask managers to define the objective for the company’s manufacturing function, and they will cite a concrete goal, such as output and cost. Ask for a measure of productivity, and they will refer to cycle times. But pricing is difficult to pin down. High unit sales and increased market share sound promising but they may in fact mean that a price is too low. And forgone profits do not appear on anyone’s scorecard. Indeed, judging pricing quality from outcomes reported on financial statements is perilous business.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            21. who is the rightful owner of Rosetta Stone?200 words essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The rightful owner of the Rosetta Stone is the British Museum. Since 1802, the museum has held the stone as a centerpiece of its collection and has served as its custodian. The Rosetta Stone is an ancient Egyptian relic, carved in 196 BC and discovered by French soldiers in 1799. It is an inscribed stone slab containing three versions of a decree from the Pharoah Ptolemy V. The stone is made of granodiorite and stands approximately 3 feet tall, 2 feet wide, and 11 inches thick.</p><p></p><p>The stone is of significant historical importance due to the inscriptions on it. The three languages are hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek. The combination of these languages helped scholars to decipher hieroglyphs, which had been previously indecipherable. This enabled scholars to gain greater insight into the ancient Egyptian civilization, which was a major breakthrough in the field of archaeology.</p><p></p><p>The stone was eventually acquired by the British Museum in 1802. Since then, the museum has served as its custodian and has displayed it in its public gallery. The stone has a unique place in the museum and is visited by thousands of people every year.</p><p></p><p>The Rosetta Stone is one of the most important archaeological relics in the world and has been a source of great fascination to scholars and historians alike. Its rightful owner is the British Museum, who has served as its custodian for more than two centuries. The museum has held the stone as a centerpiece of its collection and has made it available for public viewing, thus allowing the world to gain further insight into the ancient Egyptian civilization.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Rosetta Stone is an ancient artifact that has become an object of much controversy over the years, with various groups claiming ownership. The Rosetta Stone is a granodiorite stele inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis in 196 BC, during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King Ptolemy V. It was discovered by French soldiers in 1799 during the Napoleonic Wars, and subsequently fell into British hands after the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801.</p><p></p><p>The question of who the rightful owner of the Rosetta Stone is has been a subject of much debate between the French and the British. The French argue that the stone should be returned to Egypt, as it was discovered by French soldiers and is an important part of Egypt's cultural heritage. The British, on the other hand, argue that they have the right to keep the stone, as it was legally acquired under the terms of the Treaty of Alexandria.</p><p></p><p>While there are valid arguments on both sides, it is important to consider the ethical implications of owning such an important historical artifact. The Rosetta Stone is not just a simple stone, but a piece of history that belongs to all humanity. It holds the key to unlocking the secrets of ancient Egyptian culture and language, and therefore belongs to the world as a whole.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it is my belief that the rightful owner of the Rosetta Stone is not any one nation or group, but the entire world. The stone should be kept in a museum where it can be appreciated by people from all over the globe. This way, everyone can benefit from its historical significance and learn more about ancient Egypt's rich cultural heritage. The Rosetta Stone is not just a valuable possession, but a treasure that should be shared with the world.</p><p></p><br />

                            23. who is the rightful owner of Rosetta stone​?200 words</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Rosetta Stone is one of the most important and celebrated archaeological discoveries of all time. It is a fragment of a larger stone stele, or pillar, created in 196 BC during the reign of Pharaoh Ptolemy V Epiphanes. The stone is made of granodiorite, a hard, igneous rock and is inscribed in two languages, Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic, and Ancient Greek. It contains a decree passed by a council of priests that states that Ptolemy V is to be worshiped as a god, and describes his various offerings to Egyptian temples and shrines.</p><p></p><p>The Rosetta Stone was discovered by a French soldier in 1799 in the Egyptian city of Rosetta and soon became an object of intense archaeological interest. Upon its discovery, it was annexed to the British Museum, where it has remained ever since. In the original preamble to the 1802 decree liberally translating the Stone's inscriptions, Britain declared itself the rightful owner of the Stone.</p><p></p><p>The legitimacy of Britain's claim to the Stone has long been a point of contention. Before its discovery, Britain had no claim to the Stone, considering the fact that it was buried in the sands of the Nile Delta for nearly two centuries. While Britain has argued that the Rosetta Stone falls under the doctrine of prescriptive rights, which states that ownership of abandoned objects belong to the finder, this argument is disputed as modern international law holds that any valuables discovered in a foreign country belong to the country of origin.</p><p></p><p>This legal dispute has yet to be fully settled. Whether Britain is the rightful owner of the Rosetta Stone or not may be determined in the future, but it is currently housed in the British Museum in London and accessible to anyone who is interested in viewing it. Despite its controversial ownership issues, the Stone continues to be a symbol of ancient Egyptian culture, and a prime example of the historical importance of multilingual communication.</p><p></p><p><strong>(</strong><strong>Answered </strong><strong>with </strong><strong>Knowledge </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>Valid </strong><strong>Opinions </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>help </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>guide </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>questioners.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>No </strong><strong>copies </strong><strong>from </strong><strong>anyone </strong><strong>nor </strong><strong>any </strong><strong>website)</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Rosetta Stone is a granodiorite stele inscribed with a decree issued in 196 BC on behalf of King Ptolemy V of Egypt. The decree, written in three scripts, is one of the most important archaeological discoveries in history and is considered to be the key to unlocking ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. The Stone is currently housed in the British Museum in London, England.</p><p></p><p>The rightful owner of the Rosetta Stone is a matter of debate. Many countries and institutions have laid claim to the Stone, including the British Museum, the Egyptian government, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).</p><p></p><p>The British Museum has argued that the Stone is a part of the museum’s collection and should remain in London. The museum has stated that the Stone was legally acquired in 1801 by the British Army and was gifted to the museum in 1802 by the British government.</p><p></p><p>The Egyptian government has argued that the Stone was illegally acquired by the British Army and should be returned to Egypt. The Egyptian government has also argued that the Stone is an important part of the country’s cultural heritage and should be returned to its rightful owners.</p><p></p><p>UNESCO has argued that the Stone is an important part of humanity’s shared cultural heritage and should be shared by all nations. UNESCO has proposed that the Stone should be placed in a “neutral” location, such as a museum in a third country, where it could be studied and appreciated by all.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the rightful owner of the Rosetta Stone is a matter of dispute. It is clear, however, that the Stone is an important artifact of human history and should be treated with respect and appreciation by all.</p><br />
