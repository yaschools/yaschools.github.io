                                            1. Assume that you are an employee of a big company and you are expecting to be promoted as Director of the Marketing Department. Currently, as the Advertising Supervisor of the Marketing Department, five managers and two contractual (paid per hour) workers are working under you. According to the annual salary review of the company, you were given the flexibility to grant your employees a 3% salary increase; however, you are strongly considering to lower the amount. Doing so, you will ensure that your department's expenses stay under budget and will send a message that you are able to control costs. What are the different factors (provide at least three) that you need to consider in making the final decision? How would you proceed?2. As part of your final grade in this course, you are required to identify three classmates to be interviewed by the teacher in order to get a perspective on your overall performance. Your friend has offered to give you the best review if you agree to do the same for him/her. However, you know that your friend is not a very studious student, and his/her outputs are often below minimum standards. However, he/she is a good friend, and you would hate to upset him/her. What would you do?3. You are a member of the panel to interview new applicants to the company. During the process, you are always looking at the experience and knowledge of the candidates as deciding factors for possible recruitment. One of the candidates, Mark, is highly recommended based on his work experience and technical knowledge. On the other hand, a candidate named John has subpar knowledge and irrelevant work experience. During the deliberation, your immediate manager told you that John is his nephew, giving you a hint that your immediate manager favored John over Mark. What would you do? Would you choose Mark or John? Why?Pwede nyo rin eh tagalog ang mga sagot nyo​</a>

                                            What is Itq &amp;particularFolk songs in general have the following characteristicsA. The lyrics are according to the native tongue.Because songs are based on the daily experiences of the peoplein aplace and the message of the songs needs to be understood easily to be appreciated,the lyrics of the songs are written or sung in their own dialects. For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirPamulinawen). The Kapampangan's Atin Cu Pung Singsing, and the Bicolano'sown dialects. Why do you think it is important for a folk song to be sung or writtenin their native tongue?B. Passed down through oral tradition to family or community members, hence,learned by mere memorizationSinging is a form of social bonding among early Filipino families. Because theydid not have access to internet, T.V. and radio during that time, singing folksongsbecame their favorite pastime.C. Unknown composers and lyricistsMost composers of Filipino folk songs are unknown because songs are justbased on daily experiences and are passed down orally.D. Simple key signature of the songDo you know how to play a guitar? If you can play this instrument, you cantry to play a simple folk song. While playing, you will notice that it starts with aparticular key (key of G for example) and ends in that same key. That only shows thesimplicity of the Luzon folk songs.E. Duple, triple, or, quadruple are common meters usedThese meters were very common during that time. The dances and commonsongs are based on these meters. The composers of the folk songs adopted theserhythmic patterns to their compositions.What folk songs do you know? Can you identify the meters used based on thediscussion in the review section of this module?F. Primarily based on the community's culture, tradition and livelihood​</a>

Currently, as the Advertising Supervisor of the Marketing Department, five managers and two contractual (paid per hour) workers are working under you. According to the annual salary review of the company, you were given the flexibility to grant your employees a 3% salary increase; however, you are strongly considering to lower the amount. Doing so, you will ensure that your department's expenses stay under budget and will send a message that you are able to control costs. What are the different factors (provide at least three) that you need to consider in making the final decision? How would you proceed?2. As part of your final grade in this course, you are required to identify three classmates to be interviewed by the teacher in order to get a perspective on your overall performance. Your friend has offered to give you the best review if you agree to do the same for him/her.

                            22. What is Itq &amp;particularFolk songs in general have the following characteristicsA. The lyrics are according to the native tongue.Because songs are based on the daily experiences of the peoplein aplace and the message of the songs needs to be understood easily to be appreciated,the lyrics of the songs are written or sung in their own dialects. For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirPamulinawen). The Kapampangan's Atin Cu Pung Singsing, and the Bicolano'sown dialects. Why do you think it is important for a folk song to be sung or writtenin their native tongue?B. Passed down through oral tradition to family or community members, hence,learned by mere memorizationSinging is a form of social bonding among early Filipino families. Because theydid not have access to internet, T.V. and radio during that time, singing folksongsbecame their favorite pastime.C. Unknown composers and lyricistsMost composers of Filipino folk songs are unknown because songs are justbased on daily experiences and are passed down orally.D. Simple key signature of the songDo you know how to play a guitar? If you can play this instrument, you cantry to play a simple folk song. While playing, you will notice that it starts with aparticular key (key of G for example) and ends in that same key. That only shows thesimplicity of the Luzon folk songs.E. Duple, triple, or, quadruple are common meters usedThese meters were very common during that time. The dances and commonsongs are based on these meters. The composers of the folk songs adopted theserhythmic patterns to their compositions.What folk songs do you know? Can you identify the meters used based on thediscussion in the review section of this module?F. Primarily based on the community's culture, tradition and livelihood​</h2><br />

                            27. Can you translate this to tagalog?
Vicki Baum's evocative historical novel recounts the lives of peasants and nobles in colonial Bali, reared against a backdrop of bloodshed and cultural invasion. Dutch imperialism brings upheaval and revolution to the beautiful island, and the Balinese rebel in what would become a powerful and poignant example of symbolic resistance. A Tale from Bali culminates with the historic Battle of Badung, in which thousands of Balinese soldiers, clothed in white and armed only with daggers, threw themselves upon the merciless efficiency of the Dutch guns.

                        <p>Ang nobelang pangkasaysayan ni Vicki Baum ay nagkukuwento tungkol sa buhay ng mga dukha at maharlika sa kolonyal na Bali, na nasadlak sa isang panahon ng digmaan at kultural na pagsalakay. Ang imperyalismong Dutch ay nagdala ng pagunlad at rebolusyon sa magandang isla, at ang rebeldeng Balinese sa magiging isang mabisang halimbawa ng masimbolong pagalsa. Ang "A Tale from Bali" ay naganap sa Labanan ng Badung, kung saan libu-libong mga sundalong Balinese, na hawak lang ay kutsilyo, ay sumugod sa walang awang kahusayan ng mga baril ng mga Dutch.</p><p>Translated by: DJ Nepomuceno @ Brainly</p><br />
