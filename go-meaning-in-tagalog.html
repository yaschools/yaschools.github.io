                                            What's More Learning Task 3: People tend to be more tolerant of another culture's customs when they understand and learn the meaning behind them. In order to understand an unfamiliar culture, social scientists conduct researches. The best way to do this study is to experience that culture by living with people practicing it. Additionally, this experience should be done for a long period. In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or other ethnicity. If you know someone who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects. Since you are not allowed to go out at present because of the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, look for someone who is near to your place or whom you have contact with through social media. Be guided with the following questions as you write your case study: 1. Describe the group of people that you chose. Who are they? What do they do? Where did they come from? What do you know about them?​</a>

                                            favor to translate this in Tagalog but by thought and not word by word (like Google ). thank you! Indeed, how heartbreaking and devasting to only hear from the word "unemployment". But what more could it be when we learn further about it? What does "unemployment" really mean? Is it just the lack of one's source of living? Or is there more to it than just that? What are the news and articles pertaining to it trying to address? What are they trying to imply? What happens to those affected by this certain issue? The people, their families, status, lifestyle, their country? And oh, the economy. A lot of questions linger in our minds, leaving us a mark on what "unemployment" really is, and how far it can go and affect us. These questions, they add up and increase; yet, they remain unanswered. Thus, the making of this essay has a major goal of fulfilling the thoughts, untiringly lingering in our minds about the true essence of "unemployment", its aspects, effects, how to cope with it, and more.​</a>

                                            translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</a>

cope with life. Good mental health makes you function
comfortably in the society. It denotes a sound state of
mind that allows you to face and accept realities in life.

Emotional health is a component of mental health. If you are in control of your
thoughts, feelings, and behavior, you are emotionally healthy. It means that you can
deal positively with reality, regardless whether the actual situation is good or bad.
How you feel affects how you think and act. If you are happy, you feel relaxed
doing even the most difficult tasks, But if you are sad, tensed or worried, you cannot
think properly and may not be able to do or finish a task.</a>

In order to understand an unfamiliar culture, social scientists conduct researches. The best way to do this study is to experience that culture by living with people practicing it. Additionally, this experience should be done for a long period. In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or other ethnicity. If you know someone who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects. Since you are not allowed to go out at present because of the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, look for someone who is near to your place or whom you have contact with through social media. Be guided with the following questions as you write your case study: 1. Describe the group of people that you chose. Who are they? What do they do? Where did they come from? What do you know about them?​</h2><br />

What happens to those affected by this certain issue? The people, their families, status, lifestyle, their country? And oh, the economy. A lot of questions linger in our minds, leaving us a mark on what "unemployment" really is, and how far it can go and affect us. These questions, they add up and increase; yet, they remain unanswered. Thus, the making of this essay has a major goal of fulfilling the thoughts, untiringly lingering in our minds about the true essence of "unemployment", its aspects, effects, how to cope with it, and more.​</h2><br />

O may higit pa rito kaysa iyon lamang? Ano ang sinusubukang tugunan ng mga balita at artikulong nauukol dito? Ano ang sinusubukan nilang ipahiwatig? Ano ang mangyayari sa mga apektado ng isyung ito?

                            10. translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</h2><br />

mind that allows you to face and accept realities in life.
2)How can you explain this? In tagalog
Emotional health is a component of mental health. If you are in control of your
thoughts, feelings, and behavior, you are emotionally healthy. It means that you can
deal positively with reality, regardless whether the actual situation is good or bad.
How you feel affects how you think and act. If you are happy, you feel relaxed
doing even the most difficult tasks, But if you are sad, tensed or worried, you cannot
think properly and may not be able to do or finish a task.</h2><br />
