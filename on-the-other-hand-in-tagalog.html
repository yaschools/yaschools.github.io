Roles Played by Robotics.Robots play different roles not only in the lives of the people but also in the society as a whole. They are primarily used to ease the workload of mankind. They were invented to make life more efficient and less stressful. On one hand, they perform complicated activities which human beings are incapable of doing. On the other hand, they perform the simplest tasks at home so that their master can perform the complex ones without stressing themselves over the simple tasks.​</a>

                                            They had moved here to the island of Mindoro about a year ago because Julio had been unable to find any land of his own to farm. As it was, he thought himself lucky when Ka Ponso agreed to take him on as a tenant. “Dear Compadre,” he started writing. A while before, his wife had given birth to a baby. Ka Ponso had happened to be in the neighborhood and offered to be the baby’s godfather. After that they had begun to call each other compadre. Julio was writing in Tagalog, bending earnestly over a piece of paper torn out of his son’s school notebook. It was many months since he had had a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the municipal office in Mansalay to file a homestead application. Then he had used a pen and, to his surprise, he had been able to fill in the blank form neatly. Nothing had come of the application, although Ka Ponso had assured him he had looked into the matter and talked with the officials concerned. Now, using a pencil instead of a pen, Julio was sure he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso. Answer the following questions based on the text. 1. Who had moved to the island of Mindoro? 2. Why did they move to the island? 3. How did Ka Ponso help him? 4. How are Ka Ponso and Julio related to each other? 5. What was it that Julio was happy about? 6. What positive characteristics did Julio show in the story? Did you admire him for that? Why, explain your answer.</a>

                                            Lesson 12: MAT WEAVING ( pp. 174-175)
➢A mat, banig in Tagalog, is used for
sleeping or sitting on the floor.
➢Banig or brown mat is a traditional
hand-woven mat.
➢ Banig weaving is a genuine treasure
handed down as a tradition or a trade
from one generation to another as it is
widely practiced in the country.
❖In Basey, Samar in the Visayas, weaving has become
one of the major source of livelihood.
❖People of Basey make fine woven mats which are made
of tikog leaves, a special reed grass which grow in
swampy areas along fields. The leaves are dyed with
different strong colors to make beautiful, colorful and
unique designs.
❖Local weavers are usually housewives who want to
have another source of income for the family. They are
traditionally called paraglara.
❖The Samals of the Sulu Archipelago also make their own
mats made of buri leaves.
❖One of the artistic craftsmanship of the Samal tribe in
Laminusa was awarded by the government, the
Manlilikha ng Bayan Award (National Folk Artist) in
1990.
❖The people of the island of Romblon have a unique style
for weaving their own mats that involves delicate lace-like
edges. It is also made out of buri leaves.
❖ Basketry is a form of indigenous art. Like mat weaving, it
has become a good source of living for many Filipinos
living in cultural countries.

                                            Can you translate it in tagalog? "Accident
The fallacy of accident begins with the statement of some principle that is true as a general rule, but then errs by applying this principle to a specific case that is unusual or atypical in some way.
•	Women earn less than men earn for doing the same work. 
•	Oprah Winfrey is a woman. 
•	Therefore, Oprah Winfrey earns less than male talk-show hosts.
As we'll soon see, a true universal premise would entail the truth of this conclusion; but then, a universal statement that "Every woman earns less than any man." would obviously be false. The truth of a general rule, on the other hand, leaves plenty of room for exceptional cases, and applying it to any of them is fallacious."</a>

                                            Why The Sky is High (Tagalog myth)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on Earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was, therefore, his father's right hand man.  He was always helping with the work in the field, and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily.  In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility.  He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the cooking.  He also pounded the palay that his father and Ingat harvested.  Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name.  Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground.  Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual.   He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.   His anger added to his strength and desire to finish the work quickly.  So he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised.  In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.  When he finished pounding rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen, and that is why it is where it is today.1.	Who are the brothers?2.	Who was careful in everything he did?3.	How did Daskol do his work?4.	Did Daskol like the work of pounding rice? Yes or no?5.	Why did Daskol become irritated while pounding rice one day? Choose the letter only.a.

                                            What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</a>

                                            Learning Task 2 Read "Where's the Patis?" by Carmen Guerrero Nakpil. As you read the selection, STOP when you see a dish illustration and answer the question. What is the great Filipino dream? Where's the Patis? Carmen Guerrero Nakpil A Filipino may denationalize himself but not his stomach. He may travel over the seven seas, the five continents, the two hemispheres and lose the savor of home, forget his identity and believe himself a citizen of the world. But he remains- gastronomically, at least, always c Filipino. For, if in no other way, the Filipino loves his country with his stomach. 2 Travel has become the great Filipino dream. In the same way that an American dreams of becoming a millionaire or an English boy dreams of going to one of the great universities, the Filipino dreams of going abroad. His most constant vision is that of himself as a tourist. * To visit Hongkong, Tokyo and other cities of Asia, perchance or to catch a glimpse of Rome, Paris or London or to go to America (even for only a week in c flyspecked motel in California) is the sum of all delights. 4 Yet having left Manila International Airport in a pink cloud of despedidas and sampaguita garlands and pabilin, the dream turns into a nightmare very quickly. But why? Because the first bastion of the Filipino spirit is the palate. And in all the palaces and fleshpots and skyscrapers of that magic world called "abroad there is no patis to be had Which international cities do Filipinos want to visit the most? 5 Consider the Pinoy abroad. He has discarded the barong tagalog or "polo" for a dark, sleek Western suit. He takes to the habiliments from Hongkong, Brooks Brothers or Savile Row with the greatest of ease. He has also shed the casual informality of manner that is characteristically Filipino. He gives himself the airs of a cosmopolite to the credit card born. He is extravagantly courteous (especially in a borrowed language) and has taken to hand- kissing and to plenty of American "D'you mind's?" How can you describe the "Pinoy" being in a foreign country?​</a>

                                            Please help me guys explain this in tagalog 1. The relation between individual and society is very close. Essentially, “society” is the regularities, customs and ground rules of antihuman behavior. These practices are tremendously important to know how humans act and interact with each other. Society does not exist independently without individual. 2. The individual lives and acts within society but society is nothing, in spite of the combination of individuals for cooperative effort. On the other hand, society exists to serve individuals not the other way around. Human life and society almost go together. The relationship between individual and society is ultimately one of the profound of all the problems of social philosophy.3. The ultimate goal of society is to promote good and happy life for its individuals. It creates conditions and opportunities for the all round development of individual personality. ​</a>

Ka Ponso had happened to be in the neighborhood and offered to be the baby’s godfather. After that they had begun to call each other compadre. Julio was writing in Tagalog, bending earnestly over a piece of paper torn out of his son’s school notebook. It was many months since he had had a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the municipal office in Mansalay to file a homestead application. Then he had used a pen and, to his surprise, he had been able to fill in the blank form neatly. Nothing had come of the application, although Ka Ponso had assured him he had looked into the matter and talked with the officials concerned. Now, using a pencil instead of a pen, Julio was sure he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso. Answer the following questions based on the text. 1. Who had moved to the island of Mindoro? 2. Why did they move to the island? 3. How did Ka Ponso help him? 4. How are Ka Ponso and Julio related to each other? 5. What was it that Julio was happy about? 6. What positive characteristics did Julio show in the story? Did you admire him for that? Why, explain your answer.</h2><br />

                            6. Lesson 12: MAT WEAVING ( pp. 174-175)
➢A mat, banig in Tagalog, is used for
sleeping or sitting on the floor.
➢Banig or brown mat is a traditional
hand-woven mat.
➢ Banig weaving is a genuine treasure
handed down as a tradition or a trade
from one generation to another as it is
widely practiced in the country.
❖In Basey, Samar in the Visayas, weaving has become
one of the major source of livelihood.
❖People of Basey make fine woven mats which are made
of tikog leaves, a special reed grass which grow in
swampy areas along fields. The leaves are dyed with
different strong colors to make beautiful, colorful and
unique designs.
❖Local weavers are usually housewives who want to
have another source of income for the family. They are
traditionally called paraglara.
❖The Samals of the Sulu Archipelago also make their own
mats made of buri leaves.
❖One of the artistic craftsmanship of the Samal tribe in
Laminusa was awarded by the government, the
Manlilikha ng Bayan Award (National Folk Artist) in
1990.
❖The people of the island of Romblon have a unique style
for weaving their own mats that involves delicate lace-like
edges. It is also made out of buri leaves.
❖ Basketry is a form of indigenous art. Like mat weaving, it
has become a good source of living for many Filipinos
living in cultural countries.

The fallacy of accident begins with the statement of some principle that is true as a general rule, but then errs by applying this principle to a specific case that is unusual or atypical in some way.
•	Women earn less than men earn for doing the same work. 
•	Oprah Winfrey is a woman. 
•	Therefore, Oprah Winfrey earns less than male talk-show hosts.
As we'll soon see, a true universal premise would entail the truth of this conclusion; but then, a universal statement that "Every woman earns less than any man." would obviously be false. The truth of a general rule, on the other hand, leaves plenty of room for exceptional cases, and applying it to any of them is fallacious."</h2><br />

Why The Sky is High (Tagalog myth)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on Earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was, therefore, his father's right hand man.  He was always helping with the work in the field, and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily.  In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility.  He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the cooking.  He also pounded the palay that his father and Ingat harvested.  Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name.  Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground.  Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual.   He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.   His anger added to his strength and desire to finish the work quickly.  So he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised.  In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.  When he finished pounding rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen, and that is why it is where it is today.1.	Who are the brothers?2.	Who was careful in everything he did?3.

                            27. What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</h2><br />

                            29. Please help me guys explain this in tagalog 1. The relation between individual and society is very close. Essentially, “society” is the regularities, customs and ground rules of antihuman behavior. These practices are tremendously important to know how humans act and interact with each other. Society does not exist independently without individual. 2. The individual lives and acts within society but society is nothing, in spite of the combination of individuals for cooperative effort. On the other hand, society exists to serve individuals not the other way around. Human life and society almost go together. The relationship between individual and society is ultimately one of the profound of all the problems of social philosophy.3. The ultimate goal of society is to promote good and happy life for its individuals. It creates conditions and opportunities for the all round development of individual personality. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Ang pagkakaugnay ng isang tao sa kanyang lipunan ay malalim. Ang lipunan ay ang mga batas, tradisyon at ang sukatan ng paghuhusga sa kung ano nga ba ang hangganan ng mga batas pantao. Ang mga kasanayang ito  ay napakahalagang malaman kung papaano makipagkapwa-tao. Ang lipunan ay hindi magiging lipunan kung wala ang mga indibidwal na nasasakupan nito</p><p>2. Ang mga indibidwal ang siyang gumagalaw at humihinga sa loob ng lipunan ngnit ang lipunan ay masasabing walang saysay kung hindi  magkakaroon ng pagtutulungan o pakikipagbayanihan sa mga indibidwal na nakatira rito. Sa kabilang banda, ang lipunan ay nariyan upang pagsilbihan ang mga tao at hindi ang kabaliktaran. Ang koneksiyon ng isang indibidwal sa kanyang lipunan ay isa sa pinakmalalim na problema(?) sa pilosopiyang panlipunan( social philosophy)</p><p>3. Ang pangunahing layunin ng isang lipunan ay upang ikalat ang kabutihan at kasiyahan sa buhay ng mga indibidwal nito. Ito ay lumilikha ng mga kondisyon at oportunidad na siyang nagbibigay ng kaunlaran sa  bawat tao</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
