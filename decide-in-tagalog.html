One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</a>

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

                                            1. Assume that you are an employee of a big company and you are expecting to be promoted as Director of the Marketing Department. Currently, as the Advertising Supervisor of the Marketing Department, five managers and two contractual (paid per hour) workers are working under you. According to the annual salary review of the company, you were given the flexibility to grant your employees a 3% salary increase; however, you are strongly considering to lower the amount. Doing so, you will ensure that your department's expenses stay under budget and will send a message that you are able to control costs. What are the different factors (provide at least three) that you need to consider in making the final decision? How would you proceed?2. As part of your final grade in this course, you are required to identify three classmates to be interviewed by the teacher in order to get a perspective on your overall performance. Your friend has offered to give you the best review if you agree to do the same for him/her. However, you know that your friend is not a very studious student, and his/her outputs are often below minimum standards. However, he/she is a good friend, and you would hate to upset him/her. What would you do?3. You are a member of the panel to interview new applicants to the company. During the process, you are always looking at the experience and knowledge of the candidates as deciding factors for possible recruitment. One of the candidates, Mark, is highly recommended based on his work experience and technical knowledge. On the other hand, a candidate named John has subpar knowledge and irrelevant work experience. During the deliberation, your immediate manager told you that John is his nephew, giving you a hint that your immediate manager favored John over Mark. What would you do? Would you choose Mark or John? Why?Pwede nyo rin eh tagalog ang mga sagot nyo​</a>

One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</h2><br />

Jessa took liquor from his father's shelf and offered it to her friends to drink. They knew that their parents would get mad at them because they are minors and drinking is not good for them. Yet they have decided to do it to have some fun. What do you think of their decision and action? Why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ang kanilang desisyon ay mali dahil hindi ito makakatulong sa kanilang kalusugan at mali rin ang disisyon nila na kimuha ng liquor sa kanilang magugal na hindi nag papaalam</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sa tingin ko hindi tama yung desisyon nila kasi diba minor pa lang sila kaya bawal pa silang uminom ng alak. Kahit na ang reason ng pag inom nila ay para mag saya. Hindi parin sapat yun kasi may iba pa namang paraan na maaari nilang gawin para mag celebrate hindi ang mag inom. At tsaka alam nila na magagalit yung parents nila pag nalaman na uminom sila pero ginawa parin nilang uminom. I can say that this is quite connected with peer pressure. But they have a choice and still, they choose to drink making them responsible for their choices in life. (lol)</p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

Answer the following questions:
1. What message does the lyricist, Levi Celerio, convey in his song?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>ctto:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>the famous filipino folk song "ang pipit" has a sad story. if we will try to interpet the lyrics literally, it talks about a bird who was hit by a stone. the poor creature was unable to fly because of the pain and the severity of the injury so it fell from the tree. but before it hit the ground, it expresses its worry that another bird will be sad by the former's demise and that the man was too cruel for taking an innocent living being's life.

What would you do?3. You are a member of the panel to interview new applicants to the company. During the process, you are always looking at the experience and knowledge of the candidates as deciding factors for possible recruitment.

                            24. 14. Ano ang tagalog ng Kelly had a job in a grocery store, but it didn't pay very much and she was sick of working there. Nonetheless, the work was steady and she needed all of the money that she could get. To her delight, Kelly got an interview at a big office in Tandag City for a job that paid much more. The interview went very well and the bosses all but offered her a position. They said that she would fit the role well and they promised that they would call her back within two weeks. Kelly couldn't wait to quit her job. As soon as she got back she quit her work in the store. She spent the next two weeks bragging to her coworkers about her new high-paying job in Tandag City. Yet, two weeks passed and she received no phone call. When Kelly decided to follow up on her interview, she learned that the bosses had chosen a different candidate. Kelly was crushed.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Si Kelly ay may trabaho sa isang grocery store, ngunit ito ay hindi gaanong binayaran at siya ay may sakit na magtrabaho doon. Gayunpaman, ang trabaho ay hindi nagbabago at kailangan niya ang lahat ng pera na makukuha niya. Sa kanyang tuwa, nagpa-interview si Kelly sa isang malaking opisina sa Tandag City para sa trabahong mas malaki ang sahod. Ang panayam ay naging napakahusay at ang mga amo ay nag-alok sa kanya ng isang posisyon. Babagay daw siya sa role at nangako silang tatawagan siya ulit within two weeks. Hindi na makapaghintay si Kelly na huminto sa kanyang trabaho. Pagbalik niya ay huminto siya sa kanyang trabaho sa tindahan. Ginugol niya ang sumunod na dalawang linggo sa pagyayabang sa kanyang mga katrabaho tungkol sa kanyang bagong trabahong may mataas na suweldo sa Tandag City. Gayunpaman, lumipas ang dalawang linggo at wala siyang natanggap na tawag sa telepono. Nang magpasya si Kelly na i-follow up ang kanyang panayam, nalaman niyang ibang kandidato ang pinili ng mga boss. Naiyak si Kelly.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Google translate </p><br />
