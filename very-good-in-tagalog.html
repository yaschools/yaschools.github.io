powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </a>

                                            1. Assume that you are an employee of a big company and you are expecting to be promoted as Director of the Marketing Department. Currently, as the Advertising Supervisor of the Marketing Department, five managers and two contractual (paid per hour) workers are working under you. According to the annual salary review of the company, you were given the flexibility to grant your employees a 3% salary increase; however, you are strongly considering to lower the amount. Doing so, you will ensure that your department's expenses stay under budget and will send a message that you are able to control costs. What are the different factors (provide at least three) that you need to consider in making the final decision? How would you proceed?2. As part of your final grade in this course, you are required to identify three classmates to be interviewed by the teacher in order to get a perspective on your overall performance. Your friend has offered to give you the best review if you agree to do the same for him/her. However, you know that your friend is not a very studious student, and his/her outputs are often below minimum standards. However, he/she is a good friend, and you would hate to upset him/her. What would you do?3. You are a member of the panel to interview new applicants to the company. During the process, you are always looking at the experience and knowledge of the candidates as deciding factors for possible recruitment. One of the candidates, Mark, is highly recommended based on his work experience and technical knowledge. On the other hand, a candidate named John has subpar knowledge and irrelevant work experience. During the deliberation, your immediate manager told you that John is his nephew, giving you a hint that your immediate manager favored John over Mark. What would you do? Would you choose Mark or John? Why?Pwede nyo rin eh tagalog ang mga sagot nyo​</a>

Perhaps in the city, but in the provinces it is a common thing. Mothers usually choosethe heart's choice of their children. That is why so many unfortunate young find themselves tiedto mates they hardly know, at least at the beginning.But Virgil was in luck. His mother fell in love with a girl who was also the silent choice of his ownheart. He had met her a month before and she had smiled at him. He had smiled at her too, buthad lacked the courage to speak to her.His mother took Virgil to the girl's house one afternoon and introduced him to her. After that sheand the girl's mother left them together and went off to talk about some business of their own.Virgil was still very young. Though good-looking and a bit mischievous with the girls at times, hehad never made love to any of them. So now, he sat before the girl, staring out of the windowand desperately trying to think of something to say."A beautiful sunset, is it not?" he finally said stiffly.The girl looked at him, smiled and nodded, saying "Yes" at the same time.He smiled, although there was really nothing to smile at in what either the girl or he had said.Nevertheless, he smiled again. translate in tagalog​</a>

                                            Please help me guys explain this in tagalog 1. The relation between individual and society is very close. Essentially, “society” is the regularities, customs and ground rules of antihuman behavior. These practices are tremendously important to know how humans act and interact with each other. Society does not exist independently without individual. 2. The individual lives and acts within society but society is nothing, in spite of the combination of individuals for cooperative effort. On the other hand, society exists to serve individuals not the other way around. Human life and society almost go together. The relationship between individual and society is ultimately one of the profound of all the problems of social philosophy.3. The ultimate goal of society is to promote good and happy life for its individuals. It creates conditions and opportunities for the all round development of individual personality. ​</a>

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </h2><br />

Isang araw natagpuan niya ang kanyang sarili na tumahak sa ibang landas na humantong</p><p>sa labas ng kanyang kaharian.

Nagtanong ito, “Saan ka pupunta</p><p>galing sa pinaka maganda?" Paglingon niya ay nakita niya ang isang binata na kamukha ng kanyang ama</p><p>mas patas. Gusto niyang tumakas, ngunit nang muli siyang tumingin sa kanya, nakita niyang nakangiti ito sa kanya. Pagkuha</p><p>lakas ng loob niyang sumagot, "Ako si Luna, anak ng diyos ng araw."

                            7. 1. Assume that you are an employee of a big company and you are expecting to be promoted as Director of the Marketing Department. Currently, as the Advertising Supervisor of the Marketing Department, five managers and two contractual (paid per hour) workers are working under you. According to the annual salary review of the company, you were given the flexibility to grant your employees a 3% salary increase; however, you are strongly considering to lower the amount. Doing so, you will ensure that your department's expenses stay under budget and will send a message that you are able to control costs. What are the different factors (provide at least three) that you need to consider in making the final decision? How would you proceed?2. As part of your final grade in this course, you are required to identify three classmates to be interviewed by the teacher in order to get a perspective on your overall performance. Your friend has offered to give you the best review if you agree to do the same for him/her. However, you know that your friend is not a very studious student, and his/her outputs are often below minimum standards. However, he/she is a good friend, and you would hate to upset him/her. What would you do?3. You are a member of the panel to interview new applicants to the company. During the process, you are always looking at the experience and knowledge of the candidates as deciding factors for possible recruitment. One of the candidates, Mark, is highly recommended based on his work experience and technical knowledge. On the other hand, a candidate named John has subpar knowledge and irrelevant work experience. During the deliberation, your immediate manager told you that John is his nephew, giving you a hint that your immediate manager favored John over Mark. What would you do? Would you choose Mark or John? Why?Pwede nyo rin eh tagalog ang mga sagot nyo​</h2><br />

                            8. Virgil was only seventeen years old - still young but his mother thought he was old enough, soshe courted a girl for him.Strange? Perhaps in the city, but in the provinces it is a common thing. Mothers usually choosethe heart's choice of their children. That is why so many unfortunate young find themselves tiedto mates they hardly know, at least at the beginning.But Virgil was in luck. His mother fell in love with a girl who was also the silent choice of his ownheart. He had met her a month before and she had smiled at him. He had smiled at her too, buthad lacked the courage to speak to her.His mother took Virgil to the girl's house one afternoon and introduced him to her. After that sheand the girl's mother left them together and went off to talk about some business of their own.Virgil was still very young. Though good-looking and a bit mischievous with the girls at times, hehad never made love to any of them. So now, he sat before the girl, staring out of the windowand desperately trying to think of something to say."A beautiful sunset, is it not?" he finally said stiffly.The girl looked at him, smiled and nodded, saying "Yes" at the same time.He smiled, although there was really nothing to smile at in what either the girl or he had said.Nevertheless, he smiled again. translate in tagalog​</h2><br />

Marahil sa lungsod, ngunit sa mga probinsya ito ay isang pangkaraniwang bagay. Karaniwang pinipili ng mga ina</p><p>pinili ng puso ng kanilang mga anak. Kaya naman maraming kapus-palad na kabataan ang nakatali</p><p>sa mga kapareha na halos hindi nila kilala, kahit sa simula.</p><p>Pero maswerte si Virgil. Ang kanyang ina ay umibig sa isang batang babae na siya rin ang tahimik na pinili ng kanyang sarili</p><p>puso. Nakilala niya ito noong isang buwan at ngumiti ito sa kanya. Nakangiti din siya sa kanya, pero</p><p>ay walang lakas ng loob na kausapin siya.</p><p>Dinala ng kanyang ina si Virgil sa bahay ng dalaga isang hapon at ipinakilala ito sa kanya. Pagkatapos niyan</p><p>at iniwan silang magkasama ng ina ng batang babae at umalis upang pag-usapan ang tungkol sa kanilang sariling negosyo.</p><p>Napakabata pa ni Virgil. Kahit na maganda at medyo pilyo sa mga babae minsan, siya</p><p>ay hindi kailanman nakipag-ibigan sa alinman sa kanila. Kaya ngayon, umupo siya sa harap ng babae, nakatingin sa labas ng bintana</p><p>at pilit na nag-iisip ng sasabihin.</p><p>"Isang magandang paglubog ng araw, hindi ba?" matigas na sabi niya sa wakas.</p><p>Tumingin sa kanya ang dalaga, ngumiti at tumango, sabay sabing "Oo".</p><p>Ngumiti siya, although wala naman talagang dapat ngitian sa sinabi ng dalaga o niya.</p><p>Gayunpaman, ngumiti ulit siya.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>All soils contain mineral particles, organic matter, water and air. The combinations of these determine the soil’s properties – its texture, structure, porosity, chemistry and colour.<p></p><p></p>Relative size of sand, silt and clay particles<p></p>Soil is made up of different-sized particles. Sand particles tend to be the biggest. Clay particles are very small – less than 0.002 mm.<p></p>Soil textureSoil is made up of different-sized particles. Soil texture refers to the size of the particles that make up the soil and depends on the proportion of sand, silt and clay-sized particles and organic matter in the soil. Sandy soils feel gritty when rubbed between your fingers. Silts feel smooth – a little like flour. Most clays are sticky and mouldable. If you’ve ever used pottery clay, you’ll know the feeling.<p></p>Soils are made up of different combinations of sand, silt and clay particles. Soils that are a mixture of sand, silt and clay are called loams. The name of the soil often identifies the dominant particle, for example, Timaru silt loam describes a soil that has a predominance of silt. Other examples of New Zealand soils are Waikare clay and Te Kopuru sand.<p></p><p></p>Soil formation<p></p>Professor Louis Schipper from Waikato University briefly explains the five factors involved in soil formation.<p></p>Soil texture can influence whether soils are free draining, whether they hold water and how easy it is for plant roots to grow.<p></p>Sand particles are quite big. The pore spaces between the particles in sandy soils are also quite large. This allows water to drain quickly and air to enter the soil. Sandy soils tend not to get waterlogged in winter but can be subject to drought during summer.<p>Silt particles are too small for us to see with our eyes. Silt soils have much smaller pore spaces but a lot more of them.</p>Clay particles are smaller than 0.002 mm in diameter. Clay soils are poorly drained and hold on to the water in their pore spaces for much longer. However, they can become very hard if they dry out<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#carry on learning#hope it help#brainliest answer pls<br />

Essentially, “society” is the regularities, customs and ground rules of antihuman behavior. These practices are tremendously important to know how humans act and interact with each other. Society does not exist independently without individual. 2. The individual lives and acts within society but society is nothing, in spite of the combination of individuals for cooperative effort. On the other hand, society exists to serve individuals not the other way around. Human life and society almost go together. The relationship between individual and society is ultimately one of the profound of all the problems of social philosophy.3. The ultimate goal of society is to promote good and happy life for its individuals. It creates conditions and opportunities for the all round development of individual personality. ​</h2><br />

Ang mga indibidwal ang siyang gumagalaw at humihinga sa loob ng lipunan ngnit ang lipunan ay masasabing walang saysay kung hindi  magkakaroon ng pagtutulungan o pakikipagbayanihan sa mga indibidwal na nakatira rito. Sa kabilang banda, ang lipunan ay nariyan upang pagsilbihan ang mga tao at hindi ang kabaliktaran. Ang koneksiyon ng isang indibidwal sa kanyang lipunan ay isa sa pinakmalalim na problema(?) sa pilosopiyang panlipunan( social philosophy)</p><p>3. Ang pangunahing layunin ng isang lipunan ay upang ikalat ang kabutihan at kasiyahan sa buhay ng mga indibidwal nito. Ito ay lumilikha ng mga kondisyon at oportunidad na siyang nagbibigay ng kaunlaran sa  bawat tao</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
