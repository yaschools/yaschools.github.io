                                            They had moved here to the island of Mindoro about a year ago because Julio had been unable to find any land of his own to farm. As it was, he thought himself lucky when Ka Ponso agreed to take him on as a tenant. “Dear Compadre,” he started writing. A while before, his wife had given birth to a baby. Ka Ponso had happened to be in the neighborhood and offered to be the baby’s godfather. After that they had begun to call each other compadre. Julio was writing in Tagalog, bending earnestly over a piece of paper torn out of his son’s school notebook. It was many months since he had had a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the municipal office in Mansalay to file a homestead application. Then he had used a pen and, to his surprise, he had been able to fill in the blank form neatly. Nothing had come of the application, although Ka Ponso had assured him he had looked into the matter and talked with the officials concerned. Now, using a pencil instead of a pen, Julio was sure he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso. Answer the following questions based on the text. 1. Who had moved to the island of Mindoro? 2. Why did they move to the island? 3. How did Ka Ponso help him? 4. How are Ka Ponso and Julio related to each other? 5. What was it that Julio was happy about? 6. What positive characteristics did Julio show in the story? Did you admire him for that? Why, explain your answer.</a>

                            8. They had moved here to the island of Mindoro about a year ago because Julio had been unable to find any land of his own to farm. As it was, he thought himself lucky when Ka Ponso agreed to take him on as a tenant. “Dear Compadre,” he started writing. A while before, his wife had given birth to a baby. Ka Ponso had happened to be in the neighborhood and offered to be the baby’s godfather. After that they had begun to call each other compadre. Julio was writing in Tagalog, bending earnestly over a piece of paper torn out of his son’s school notebook. It was many months since he had had a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the municipal office in Mansalay to file a homestead application. Then he had used a pen and, to his surprise, he had been able to fill in the blank form neatly. Nothing had come of the application, although Ka Ponso had assured him he had looked into the matter and talked with the officials concerned. Now, using a pencil instead of a pen, Julio was sure he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso. Answer the following questions based on the text. 1. Who had moved to the island of Mindoro? 2. Why did they move to the island? 3. How did Ka Ponso help him? 4. How are Ka Ponso and Julio related to each other? 5. What was it that Julio was happy about? 6. What positive characteristics did Julio show in the story? Did you admire him for that? Why, explain your answer.</h2><br />

our topic or title or whatever is "The Effects of Fossil Fuel: Is it Harmful to the Environment?"</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Firstly, a defense title is a concise and clear statement that summarizes the main point or argument of your research project. It should be brief and to the point, and provide a clear indication of the purpose and scope of your work. In the case of your topic, "The Effects of Fossil Fuel: Is it Harmful to the Environment?", it seems that your research is focused on examining the environmental impact of the use of fossil fuels.</p><p></p><p>To start, you can break down your title into three key components:</p><p></p><p>The Effects of Fossil Fuel - This part of your title indicates the focus of your research, which is on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source that is extracted from the earth, and include coal, oil, and natural gas.</p><p></p><p>Is it Harmful - This part of your title introduces the central question of your research, which is whether the use of fossil fuels is harmful to the environment. This question can be further refined by identifying specific aspects of the environment that are impacted by the use of fossil fuels, such as air pollution, water pollution, and climate change.</p><p></p><p>To the Environment - This part of your title indicates the scope of your research, which is focused specifically on the environmental impact of fossil fuels. It is important to be clear and specific about the scope of your research in your defense title, as this will help your audience understand the focus of your work.</p><p></p><p>Based on these three key components, you can revise your defense title to make it more concise and clear. Here's an example of a revised defense title:</p><p></p><p>"The Environmental Impact of Fossil Fuels: Assessing the Harmful Effects on Air, Water, and Climate"</p><p></p><p>I hope this helps you to better understand how to craft a defense title for your research project. Good luck with your defense!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
