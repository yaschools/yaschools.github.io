                                            read it allWhy the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​</a>

Currently, as the Advertising Supervisor of the Marketing Department, five managers and two contractual (paid per hour) workers are working under you. According to the annual salary review of the company, you were given the flexibility to grant your employees a 3% salary increase; however, you are strongly considering to lower the amount. Doing so, you will ensure that your department's expenses stay under budget and will send a message that you are able to control costs. What are the different factors (provide at least three) that you need to consider in making the final decision? How would you proceed?2. As part of your final grade in this course, you are required to identify three classmates to be interviewed by the teacher in order to get a perspective on your overall performance. Your friend has offered to give you the best review if you agree to do the same for him/her. However, you know that your friend is not a very studious student, and his/her outputs are often below minimum standards. However, he/she is a good friend, and you would hate to upset him/her. What would you do?3. You are a member of the panel to interview new applicants to the company. During the process, you are always looking at the experience and knowledge of the candidates as deciding factors for possible recruitment. One of the candidates, Mark, is highly recommended based on his work experience and technical knowledge. On the other hand, a candidate named John has subpar knowledge and irrelevant work experience. During the deliberation, your immediate manager told you that John is his nephew, giving you a hint that your immediate manager favored John over Mark. What would you do? Would you choose Mark or John? Why?Pwede nyo rin eh tagalog ang mga sagot nyo​</a>

                                            Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</a>

                            9. read it allWhy the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​</h2><br />

As part of your final grade in this course, you are required to identify three classmates to be interviewed by the teacher in order to get a perspective on your overall performance.

                            19. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</h2><br />
