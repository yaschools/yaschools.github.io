                                            inequality in one variable. History of Carmona In the late 16th century, a Spanish colonial resettlement program was implemented across wide areas of what came to be known as the province of (EXAMPLE) CAVITE. The program was designed to integrate the Filipinos into the religious and political institutions of the Spaniards. (1)__________ was first established as a mission town in 1595. Together with the other mission towns in the province, it became one of the centers of religious and economic activities in the first centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Carmona used to be a barrio of the Mission Town of Silang. It was locally known as "(2)_____________ "", a tagalog word for plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. At that time, this barrio was just a small farming community with a very small population. As its population rapidly increased, religious and political separation from the town of Silang was later sought from Spain. Eventually, it became an independent municipality on February 20, 1857 by virtue of the Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de (5)__________ The name (3_______) was adopted as a sign of gratitude to the Spanish officials who influenced the Central Government at the time of separation of the barrio. With boundaries properly delineated and a church established, it started its own religious and political administration. The people of Carmona have actively participated in the revolution against the Spaniards. It also witnessed the Filipinos' resistance against the Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation, some of Carmona's prominent houses were used as Japanese headquarters while the hills became the stronghold of Filipino revolutionaries After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions or land conflicts.​</a>

                                            1. “Mother tongue education refers to any form of schooling that makes use of the language or languages that children are most familiar with. This is usually the language that children speak at home with their family. The ‘mother tongue’ does not have to be the language spoken by the mother. Children can and often do speak more than one or even two languages at home.”
2. “Another way to grasp the concept of animatism is to differentiate the Cebuano terms gahum and kusog. Gahum comes closer to the Tagalog galing, acquired power or skill as in the case of politics, while kusog comes closer to the Tagalog lakas, an almost innate power with connotations of dynamism and energy.”

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.)</p><p></p><p>If a war were to happen in the Philippines, it would be declared by the President of the Philippines. The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and is responsible for maintaining the national security and defending the country.</p><p></p><p>The President has the authority to declare war if the country is under attack, or if there is a threat to the sovereignty or territorial integrity of the Philippines. The President may also declare war if the country is facing an imminent danger, or when there is a need to protect Filipinos abroad. It is up to the President to determine whether or not a war should be declared, and he or she has the power to do so.</p><p></p><p>The Constitution of the Philippines also states that the Congress has the authority to declare war, provided that the declaration is approved by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate. This means that the President would need the support of the Congress should he or she decide to declare war.</p><p></p><p>It is important to note that the decision to declare war is a serious one, and it should not be taken lightly. The consequences of declaring war can be far-reaching and devastating, both for the people of the Philippines and for the country as a whole. If a war were to happen in the Philippines, the President and the Congress must consider the potential ramifications before deciding to go to war.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>The military is a unique political institution and is characterized by a number of distinct features. One of the most important features of the military is its hierarchical structure. This structure is based on rank and authority, with officers and enlisted personnel occupying different positions within the chain of command. At the top of the hierarchy are the highest-ranking officers, who are responsible for making major decisions and strategy for the military. This hierarchical structure is essential for the efficient functioning of the military, as it ensures that orders are followed and that discipline is maintained.</p><p></p><p>Another important feature of the military is its non-partisan nature. The military is apolitical, meaning that it is not affiliated with any particular political party or ideology. This neutrality ensures that the military can serve to protect the nation’s interests without being influenced by partisan politics.</p><p></p><p>The military is also highly organized and disciplined. This is essential in order to ensure that it can quickly and effectively respond to threats and conflicts. The organization of the military also ensures that resources are used efficiently and that personnel are adequately trained and prepared for their roles.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the military is a professional institution. This means that military personnel are highly trained and experienced in the use of weapons and tactics. The professionalism of the military ensures that it is well-equipped to handle a wide range of tasks, from peacekeeping operations to combat operations.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the military is a unique political institution that is characterized by its hierarchical structure, non-partisan nature, organization and discipline, and professionalism. These features ensure that the military remains an effective tool for protecting the nation’s interests.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Politics is the way that people living in groups make decisions. Politics is about making agreements between people so that they can live together in groups such as tribes, cities, or countries. In large groups, such as countries, some people may spend a lot of their time making such agreements. These people are called politicians. Politicians, and sometimes other people, may get together to form a government. The study of politics in universities is called political science, political studies, or public administration.</p><p></p><p>In everyday life, the term "politics" refers to the way that countries are governed, and to the ways that governments make rules and laws. Politics can also be seen in other groups, such as in companies, clubs, schools, and churches.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Pamahalaan vs Pulitika</p><p></p><p>Ang dalawang term na ito ay kinasasangkutan ng mga tao at ang proseso na tumatagal ng isang partikular na estado. Ang parehong mga term na ito ay tumutukoy sa system na may kontrol sa bansa o estado.</p><p></p><p>Ang gobyerno ay isang termino sa agham panlipunan na tumutukoy sa ilang pangkat ng mga tao na kumukuha sa isang partikular na bansa. Ang paraan ng pamamahala ng mga organisasyong ito na pinamamahalaan ang bansa ay napaka nakaayos at nakaayos. Sa kabilang banda, ang politika ay tumutukoy sa proseso kung saan ang isang pangkat ng mga itinalagang pinuno pati na rin ang mga tao ng estado ay gumawa ng sama-samang desisyon sa iba`t ibang mga isyu sa bansa. Bagaman ang terminong "politika" ay tumutukoy pa rin sa sining o agham ng pagkontrol sa estado sa isang maayos at nakabalangkas na pamamaraan, ang politika ay magkakaiba pa rin sa iba't ibang paraan. Tulad ng nabanggit na, ang salitang "gobyerno" ay tumutukoy sa pangkat ng mga taong nagpapatakbo ng bansa samantalang ang politika ay tumutukoy sa proseso ng pagpapatakbo ng bansa.</p><p></p><p>Ang gobyerno ay katawanin ng maraming mga itinalagang pinuno na nag-monopolyo ng mga desisyon sa anumang mga sitwasyon na makakaapekto sa buong estado. Ang mga piniling pinuno na ito ay maaaring tawaging administratibong burukrasya. Ang mga piniling pinuno ay pinaghihiwalay ng katayuan bukod sa karaniwang tao ng partikular na estado. Sa mga bansang demokratiko, ang mga desisyon ng gobyerno ay maaaring may kaunting pagkagambala mula sa karaniwang mga tao ng bansa. Gayunpaman, sa karamihan ng oras mayroong talagang kaunting pagkagambala mula sa mga tao dahil ang pangwakas na desisyon sa isang partikular na sitwasyon tungkol sa estado ay nasa kamay pa rin ng gobyerno. Sa kabilang banda, ang politika ay iba. Tulad ng nabanggit na, ang gobyerno ay binubuo ng administratibong burukrasya. Ngunit sa kaso ng politika, ang term na ito ay hindi aktwal na limitado sa pamahalaan at pang-estado lamang. Mayroon ding politika sa iba`t ibang sektor ng bansa. Maaaring may politika sa paaralan kung saan may mga namumuno sa mag-aaral na naayos upang tulayin ang agwat sa pagitan ng pamamahala ng paaralan at ng mga mag-aaral nito. Ang pampulitika ay maaari ding matagpuan sa lugar ng trabaho dahil magkakaroon ng mga myembro ng ehekutibo ng isang kumpanya. Darating ito sa mga pangkat tulad ng board of director at board of trustees. Maaari rin itong dumating sa mga indibidwal tulad ng mga tagapamahala, superbisor, at iba pang nakahihigit na posisyon na nagsasaad ng pamamahala sa isang kumpanya. Bukod dito, ang politika ay maaari ding matagpuan sa mga sektor ng relihiyon. Kung ito man ay Kristiyanismo o Islam, ang politika ay maaari pa ring matagpuan sa partikular na sektor ng lipunan.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Buod:</p><p></p><p>1. Ang gobyerno ay tumutukoy sa pangkat ng mga tao na nagpapatakbo ng bansa habang ang politika ay tumutukoy sa proseso na sinusundan ng pangkat ng mga tao na ito upang patakbuhin ang bansa.</p><p></p><p>2. Ang mga gawain ng gobyerno ay bihirang makagambala ng impluwensya ng karaniwang tao samantalang ang politika ay nagsasangkot ng mas maraming tao na hiwalay sa mga pampulitikang grupo.</p><p></p><p>3. Ang gobyerno ay limitado sa pagpapatakbo ng estado habang ang politika ay maaari ding matagpuan sa edukasyon, mga korporasyon, at maging ang mga relihiyon.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
