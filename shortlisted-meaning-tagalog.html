You have waited long for this job interview and prepared a lot for it. To miss the interview is to miss a very good chance at a job opportunity that you have dreamed of since you were a kid. You are very excited and hopeful that you will get hired. You are on your way to the job interview when you suddenly receive a call from your younger sister/brother asking for your help. Your sister/brother seems confused and sounds unintelligible over the phone, and you are worried! To add to your dilemma, you sister/brother is a person with disability (PWD).What will you do? Would you rush to your sister/brother and forget about the job interview? Or would you ignore the distress call and proceed to the interview and pretend you never received the call? Or do you have any other options?​</a>

                                            Malou recently joined EAP Valdez Digital, a production house, as a Recruitment
Manager. She is in charge of preparing the shortlist of candidates for the final
interview stage based on competitive criteria. All applicants are reviewed by
Malou before the final decision for hiring is made by the applicant’s prospective
immediate superior.
One afternoon, upon returning to her desk after the lunch break, Malou finds a
long brown envelope on her table, identical to the envelopes that their company
requires applicants to submit their resumes in. Stuck at the center of the envelope
is a post-it with the following message scribbled in the handwriting of her direct
superior, Mike Mariano: “Malou, Please have her hiring papers ready by the end
of next week. Thanks. M.Mariano”
Malou opens the envelope and finds a resume for a candidate named Jessa M.
Palacios, a fresh graduate who appears to not have taken school seriously, the
kind of candidate that she would outright reject.
What should Malou do? and Why?</a>

                            11. Answer should be 5 to 10 sentences You are on your way to an important job interview that is given only to shortlisted applicants which include you. You have waited long for this job interview and prepared a lot for it. To miss the interview is to miss a very good chance at a job opportunity that you have dreamed of since you were a kid. You are very excited and hopeful that you will get hired. You are on your way to the job interview when you suddenly receive a call from your younger sister/brother asking for your help. Your sister/brother seems confused and sounds unintelligible over the phone, and you are worried! To add to your dilemma, you sister/brother is a person with disability (PWD).What will you do? Would you rush to your sister/brother and forget about the job interview? Or would you ignore the distress call and proceed to the interview and pretend you never received the call? Or do you have any other options?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If I'm in the situation like this, first thing I would do is to call someone who will help me with my sibling. May be my other siblings, or my parents. But if I don't have someone to help me, I will do it by myself, because my sibling is more important than the opportunity I have. And if I can excuse myself for the job interview, and explain to them what happened, they might give me another chance, and if they don't give me another chance, then I'll just wait or look for another opportunity. </p><br />

                            17. Malou recently joined EAP Valdez Digital, a production house, as a Recruitment
Manager. She is in charge of preparing the shortlist of candidates for the final
interview stage based on competitive criteria. All applicants are reviewed by
Malou before the final decision for hiring is made by the applicant’s prospective
immediate superior.
One afternoon, upon returning to her desk after the lunch break, Malou finds a
long brown envelope on her table, identical to the envelopes that their company
requires applicants to submit their resumes in. Stuck at the center of the envelope
is a post-it with the following message scribbled in the handwriting of her direct
superior, Mike Mariano: “Malou, Please have her hiring papers ready by the end
of next week. Thanks. M.Mariano”
Malou opens the envelope and finds a resume for a candidate named Jessa M.
Palacios, a fresh graduate who appears to not have taken school seriously, the
kind of candidate that she would outright reject.
What should Malou do? and Why?</h2><br />

You are done planning to branch out your business to another location where you will need a branch manager. From the pool ofapplicants, you came up with a shortlist of applicants for interviews. You decided to conduct a structured interview. Create a set of interviewquestions. You may write maximum 6 questions as many as you can.​</h2><br />

                            24. Your supervisor has asked you to organize a vacation for your colleagues. A set amount has been allocated for this purpose.  You have shortlisted two destinations: Fancy Land and Heaven Island. How would you decide where to go?</h2><br />
                        <p>I would consider the following before deciding where to go on a vacation with my colleagues. First, the length of our vacation. Most employees work from Monday to Friday, so the vacation granted with the colleagues would probably be only applied on a weekend, could be overnight. Second, the distance of the place from us. Time travel should also be considered if only given limited days of vacation. Lastly, it is proper to ask my colleagues what they would also prefer. Since I already have two choices, I’d give them some ideas about each place and what activities we could do, as well as the accommodation and food we may experience. </p><br /><p>Based on the shortlisted destinations, personally, I think I would prefer the Fancy Land. Because, when we say fancy, it sounds decorated and structured. The place could be very attractive to visitors. With the day(s) allotted to the vacationers, I think Fancy Land would be more manageable. However, on the other hand, Heaven Island sounds like a very convincing place to relax and unwind, far from the hustle and bustle of the city. In this case, you really need to have a longer days of vacation, unless approved by your supervisor, then this will be chosen.</p><br />
