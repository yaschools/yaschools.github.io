Thanks. </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>What is feminist</strong></p><p>Feminist is the one who supports feminism. Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes.</p><p>2. <strong>What is misogynist</strong></p><p>A person who dislikes, despises, or is strongly prejudiced against women.</p><p>3.<strong>What are the difference between feminist and misogynist</strong></p><p><strong> A feminist is someone who subscribes to the ideology of feminism. A misogynist is someone who dislikes and/or hates women. Under that definition, the two are polar opposites since feminism is EXTREMELY gynocentric.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>However, misogyny is a word that is so overused that it feels like the definition has changed. People typically use the word to mean sexist or prejudiced against women. In my honest opinion, feminism is sexist against women. Here's my thought process.<strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>Women have more legal rights than men in western society. We are in no way disadvantaged in an actual, tangible sense. Feminists rarely even attempt to argue that we are lacking in legal rights when compared to men because it isn't true and facts aren't something that can be swayed by opinion. Instead, feminists say that the way women are discriminated against goes beyond the law. I think this is very interesting because that means that feminism must make the assumption that women are less capable than men to ward off oppression. Women aren't minorities so it isn't like men could opress us by sheer numbers. They could oppress us by physical force because the average woman is physically weaker, however if that were the case, the discrimination would be much more extreme and undeniable. Instead, women are oppressed by the way men behave and the words they say, according to feminism.<strong> This is what feminism is implying but not outright declaring:

</strong></p><p><strong>Women lack the mental fortitude to be intellectually autonomous from men. That is why their occasional mean words is so damaging and why something like "internalized misogyny" exists. Men are intellectually stronger, therefore mean words directed at them isn't so bad.
</strong></p><p><strong>Because women are intellectually weaker than men, they need to be protected from criticism and sexy pictures of other women in the media. Young women are so intellectually fragile that their entire psyche is easily damaged by a picture of a woman more attractive than them. This causes them to develop eating disorders and other horrific mental illnesses. Young boys do not have this issue and pictures of sexy men doesn't damage them. Online harassment against men also isn't as important because they are tough enough to handle it unlike women.
</strong></p><p><strong>Women need organizations like NOW and groups like feminism because they are too weak to make their own voices heard for themselves. They also need "he for she" groups because they need men to fight their battles for them. They also aren't taken more seriously in board rooms because they are too weak to make their voices heard.
</strong></p><p><strong>Women need affirmative action in order to get certain jobs and get into schools because they obviously can't do it on their own.

                            5. Why shouldn't women be in politics? (This is for a debate I'm not misogynistic but please answer the question properly)</h2><br />
                        <p>There are many reasons why women should not be in politics. First and foremost, women are not as emotionally stable as men, and thus are not fit to make critical decisions that could lead to war or other disasters. Secondly, women are not as logical as men, and are more likely to make decisions based on emotion rather than reason. Finally, women are not as physically strong as men, and thus would not be able to handle the rigors of political office.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Women make up a bigger share of national and state lawmakers than ever, and yet the share of women in major political positions remains disproportionately low. Women make up around 19 percent of all members of Congress and less than 25 percent of all state legislators. They also make up six of the nation's 50 governors, or 12 percent.</p><p></p><p>From one standpoint, Women make up about as big a share of Congress as they do the clergy. But there's some real perspective here. For one thing, a substantial chunk of the clergy has to be men. </p><p></p><p>The reason why the lack of women holding political office is significant is the same reason that the lack of women in the C-suite is significant. When more women hold top positions in politics and business, everyone benefits.</p><p>Studies show that women in political office tend to work in more a bipartisan manner and are more likely than their male counterparts to bring new issues and perspectives to the policy agenda. Female elected officials are also known to increase government transparency.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Despite strides in women’s representation in powerful roles, a surprising number of people across the world still don’t trust women to lead effectively. These biases are deep-seated and may be difficult to change.</p><br />

                            14. LEARNING ACTIVITY 1: GENDER CONCEPTS/ TERMS Direction: Read and understand the following passages written below and answer the questions provided. SITUATION 1: Aling Maria is married to Mang Tomas for almost 20 years. Along those years, Aling Maria endured physical abuse from Mang Tomas including slapping, striking, kicking, and beatings. When Mang Tomas is intoxicated, the assault escalates to the point that he threatened Aling Maria's life by pointing a knife in her direction. 1. What pattern of inequality is seen from the scenario written above? 2. What should the government do to avoid the similar scenarios to continuously happen? 3. What contribution can you add to address the issue stated above? SITUATION 2: In the recent 2022 elections, former Vice President Leni Robredo was the only woman among all the candidates running for presidency. Thus, she received several misogynistic remarks questioning her ability to lead because of her gender. Some critics told that she is too kind, too soft, and too emotional to become the Philippines' next leader. 1. What pattern of inequality is seen from the scenario written above? 2. What should the government do to avoid the similar scenarios to continuously happen? 3. What contribution can you add to address the issue stated above?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The pattern of inequality seen in the scenario is gender-based violence or domestic violence, where a person in a relationship uses physical or emotional abuse to assert power and control over their partner. This is a form of gender-based violence that disproportionately affects women and is rooted in patriarchal attitudes and beliefs.</p><p>2. The government can take various steps to address this issue, including:</p><p>-Enforcing laws and regulations that protect victims of domestic violence and hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.</p><p>-Providing support and resources for survivors, such as safe shelters, legal aid, and access to healthcare.</p><p>-Raising public awareness about the issue of domestic violence and its impact on women and families.</p><p>-Implementing programs and initiatives that educate the public about healthy relationships and encourage the rejection of gender-based violence and abusive behavior.</p><p>3. As an individual, you can contribute to addressing this issue by:</p><p>-Being informed and educated about domestic violence and its causes and effects.</p><p>-Supporting organizations and initiatives that work to prevent and respond to domestic violence.</p><p>-Being an ally to survivors and speaking out against gender-based violence and abusive behavior.</p><p>-Encouraging open and honest conversations about relationships and consent.</p><p>-Challenging and rejecting harmful attitudes and beliefs about gender and relationships that contribute to domestic violence.</p><p></p><p>SITUATION 2:</p><p>1. The pattern of inequality seen in the scenario is gender-based discrimination, where a person's abilities and qualifications are dismissed or questioned based on their gender. This is a form of gender-based discrimination that is rooted in patriarchal attitudes and beliefs that view women as inferior to men.</p><p>2. The government can take various steps to address this issue, including:</p><p>-Enforcing laws and regulations that protect against gender-based discrimination and ensure equal treatment for all individuals.</p><p>-Promoting gender equality through education and public awareness campaigns.</p><p>-Encouraging and supporting the participation of women in leadership and decision-making roles.</p><p>-Providing opportunities for women to access education and professional development.</p><p>3.

                            15. Do you think there was inequality in education between men and women during the time of Rizal? How are the women of today in the field of education compared to the women during the Spanish regime? From your readings cite an instance that made you believe that Rizal is misogynist?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Do you think there was inequality in education between men and women during the time of Rizal?</p><p>In his essay, "The Friars in the Philippines," James A. LeRoy, writing in 1903––less than  a decade after Rizal's death, barely more than a decade after the Fili was published––comments,  "The status of women has long been higher among the Filipinos than ever yet anywhere else in the  Orient; to the friars' introduction of Christianity belongs the credit"</p><p>How are the women of today in the field of education compared to the women during the Spanish regime? </p><p>Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, the inhabitants of the archipelago were literate and had their own system of writing that they used for communication. This writing system is often erroneously referred to as Alibata (the first three letters of the Maguindanao version of the Arabian alphabet: alif, ba, ta). It is more properly named Baybayin, which in Filipino means "to spell." Baybayin has seventeen basic symbols, three of which are vowel sounds. This writing system was used extensively by the inhabitants of the islands, as witnessed by the Spanish upon their arrival. Father Pedro Chirino, a Jesuit chronicler and historian for Miguel de Legazpi (an explorer and the first royal governor of the islands), reports in Relaciones de las Islas Filipinas that when he arrived in the islands in 1565, all the islanders, both men and women, were reading and writing. Another witness and recorder of this fact was Antonio Morga, the Senior Judge Advocate of the High Court of Justice and Commander of the galleon warship San Diego. He noted in Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas that almost all the natives, men and women alike, wrote in the Baybayin language and that there were few who did not write it excellently or correctly.</p><p>From your readings cite an instance that made you believe that Rizal is misogynist?</p><p>​Rizal grew up in a dominantly female household. His mother, Teodora Alonso, taught him at a young age and was the one who “opened his eyes and heart to the world around him—with all its soul and poetry, as well as its bigotry and injustice.” She also imbibed onto him the virtue of obedience, self-reliance, and to value education above all. But they did have a bit of a falling out when Rizal chose to become distant to the Catholic faith due to the corruption that’s happening within the church at the time.  Nonetheless, Rizal seemed to have carried the lessons that his mother taught him throughout his life. He even shared his insight on education to his sister Trinidad and how she deserved to have that privilege as a woman living in the Philippines. “For this reason, now that you are still young and you have time to learn, it is necessary that you study by reading and reading attentively. It is a pity that you allow yourself to be dominated by laziness when it takes so little effort to shake it off. It is enough to form only the habit of study and later everything goes by itself,” he wrote in a letter from Heidelberg, Germany.

She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story.

"The Story Cinderella"1.consider the values conveyed in the portrayal of the good girl as passive weak submissive, but physically beautiful; and powerful woman as wicked and probably ugly cinderella?2.Consider the protentially misogynist theme of abused-girl-waiting-to-be-rescued-by-prince?"The Story Cinderella"THESISCinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.IN THE BEGINNINGCCinderella is oppressed by her father and his new wife. She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</h2><br />
