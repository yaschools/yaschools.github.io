Robots and Computers               By Michael Chester There are certain principles common to every robot: it has to be programmable - which means that it has to contain, or be move objects according to its programmed instructions, making de- connected to, a computer. And it has to be able to move about or cisions based on its program and not entirely on commands sent by a human operator. Many robots also have "sensors-instruments that detect light, sound, pressure, and other conditions. The conditions de tected by the sensors can be transmitted to the robot's computer to make the robot change its actions--for instance, turning around and going in the opposite direction if a sensor tells it that it has bumped into a wall.                                             -Sibs Communication     Arts Series: Roads to Greatness First Edition     Grade 7 by Carleen S.

The Climb
There's always gonna be another
mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other
side
It's the c
There's always gonna be another
mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other
side
It's the climb
Jesus, Take the Wheel
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm
on
Jesus, take the wheel</a>

                                            TRUE OR FALSE 13. Distance gives complete information of the route followed by the body, while displacement does not give complete information of the route followed by the body. 14. Distance is always positive, cannot be negative and zero. 15. The unit used to express speed is meters per second (m/s), it can also be expressed in miles per hour (mi/hr or mph), kilometers per hour (km/hr or kph). 16. In calculating for average speed, you will divide the total distance travelled by the total time travelled. 17. The unit used for velocity is the same as the unit of speed like meter per second, kilometer per hour, and miles per hour. 18. If you are not changing your speed, and you are not changing your direction, then you simply cannot be accelerating, no matter how fast you are going. 19. Time is plotted on the Y-axis, while distance is plotted on the X-axis. 20. A speed-time graph shows how the speed of a moving object changes with time. 21. Speed-time graph is different from velocity-time graph. 22. In a given time, if the distance the object moves is changed (getting larger), it is accelerating. 23. A straight horizontal line on a speed-time graph means that speed is constant. It is not changing over time. Therefore, it has no acceleration. 24. A downward sloping line means that the object is slowing down. 25. A horizontal line means the object is moving at a constant speed with zero acceleration. MIT​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.	Go back to Philippine history or newspaper in the late 80s and find out how the acronym "GG" came out. Whom was it notably ascribed to? Why?  </p><p>GG means galunggong. In the Philippines, the measure of high inflation and economic depression is the price of galunggong (Blue Mackerel fish). This is because it is the cheapest food that Filipinos can eat.  </p><p>2.	What particular period in the persona's life did he relate "Ligo" to? Explain why.  </p><p>The Ligo was articulated by the author during his university days.  He explained that it was food in the ‘70s whenever there is a rally.  </p><p>3.	What did he refer to as "Balara Hilton"? Explain its implication on the politics and the life of Filipino during the Marcos regime.  </p><p>Balara Hilton is a street near UP Diliman. It’s a ramshackle house for cheaper food. The implication of it is that during the ‘70s, student rallies and picket lines were more often.  </p><p>4.	Explain what the persona means when he said : "he was indentured to City Bank for life".
</p><p>Indenture means a contract between individuals within a set time period. This refers to loans, inheritance and etc. As the author has said that because he is living in the United States and that cash is no longer king but plastic money. Because of credit and loans, he becomes a slave to corporate life and consumerism.  </p><p>5.	Why does the persona consider seafood as "one of the lousiest ironies in this country"?
</p><p>The author said that the country is rich in seafood, however, the irony is that the country is in extreme poverty. Despite the wealth in resources of the country, the locals themselves can’t afford it.  </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/13226232</p><p></p><br />

Strike 1, strike 2
Come on let’s hit the table
For one and two
What you feel and what you hear?
Back and forth movement that’s
So real and clear.
They say it’s the vibration
Caused by energy in motion
Travelling in the S-L-G medium
With the gas in minimum
But not in a vacuum.
Sound energy, sound waves in the air
Causing disturbance anywhere
Particles vibrated
Compressed and expanded
Moving in longitudinal wave.
Crest or compression, trough or
rarefaction
That’s how the waves are in motion
Resembling valleys and hills
Like going uphill and downhill.
Boom, clank, tweet, bang
Sound can be loud, soft when sang
Greater, lesser, fast and slow
That’s what we know
Varying frequencies and vibrations.

Robots and Computers               By Michael Chester There are certain principles common to every robot: it has to be programmable - which means that it has to contain, or be move objects according to its programmed instructions, making de- connected to, a computer. And it has to be able to move about or cisions based on its program and not entirely on commands sent by a human operator. Many robots also have "sensors-instruments that detect light, sound, pressure, and other conditions. The conditions de tected by the sensors can be transmitted to the robot's computer to make the robot change its actions--for instance, turning around and going in the opposite direction if a sensor tells it that it has bumped into a wall.                                             -Sibs Communication     Arts Series: Roads to Greatness First Edition     Grade 7 by Carleen S.

Come on let’s hit the table
For one and two
What you feel and what you hear?
Back and forth movement that’s
So real and clear.
They say it’s the vibration
Caused by energy in motion
Travelling in the S-L-G medium
With the gas in minimum
But not in a vacuum.
Sound energy, sound waves in the air
Causing disturbance anywhere
Particles vibrated
Compressed and expanded
Moving in longitudinal wave.
Crest or compression, trough or
rarefaction
That’s how the waves are in motion
Resembling valleys and hills
Like going uphill and downhill.
Boom, clank, tweet, bang
Sound can be loud, soft when sang
Greater, lesser, fast and slow
That’s what we know
Varying frequencies and vibrations.

 speed of sound ________.
 A. decreases 0.6 m/s every decrease of 1O C in temperature
 B. decreases 0.6 m/s every increase of 1O C in temperature
 C. increases 0.6 m/s every decrease of 1O C in temperature

A. decreases B. increases C. remains the same D. none of these
_____12. Why do sounds are more heard during warm days? It is because during warm
days the ___________.
A. kinetic energy is lower C. collision of air molecules is lower
B. kinetic energy is maintained D. collision of air molecules is greater

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>10. A. Decreases 0.6 m/s every decrease of 1oC in temperature</p><p>11. B. Increases</p><p>12. D. Collision of air molecules is greater</p><p>13. A. Moves slowly</p><p>14. A. -10oC</p><p>15. A. Faster</p><p></p><p>1. During a serve, if the ball hits the net but still bounces on the opponent's side of the table, the point is a let (which means it needs to be replayed). If the ball hits the net and doesn't make it to the other half of the table, the receiver is automatically awarded a point</p><p></p><p>2. It takes 3 different vibrations to hear a sound, since sound is made when things vibrate (or wiggle) : The object that makes the noise vibrates (our bell). The air molecules vibrate as the sound moves through the air.</p><p></p><p>3. In electromagnetic waves, energy is transferred through vibrations of electric and magnetic fields. In sound waves, energy is transferred through vibration of air particles or particles of a solid through which the sound travels.</p><p></p><p>4. When molecules in a medium vibrate, they can move back and forth or up and down. Sound energy causes the molecules to move back and forth in the same direction that the sound is travelling. (Transverse waves occur when the molecules vibrate up and down, perpendicular to the direction that the wave travels).</p><p></p><p>5. Sound waves enter the outer ear and travel through a narrow passageway called the ear canal, which leads to the eardrum. The eardrum vibrates from the incoming sound waves and sends these vibrations to three tiny bones in the middle ear. These bones are called the malleus, incus, and stapes.</p><p></p><p>6. As a rule sound travels slowest through gases, faster through liquids, and fastest through solids. The speed of light as it travels through air and space is much faster than that of sound; it travels at 300 million meters per second or 273,400 miles per hour.</p><p></p><p>7. If a sound wave is moving from left to right through air, then particles of air will be displaced both rightward and leftward as the energy of the sound wave passes through it. The motion of the particles is parallel (and anti-parallel) to the direction of the energy transport.</p><p></p><p>8. The basic components of a sound wave are frequency, wavelength and amplitude. In this example of a sound wave, the period of one cycle of this wave is 0.5 seconds, and the frequency of this wave is 2 cycles per second or 2 Hertz (Hz).</p><p></p><p>9. The number of vibrations per second is known as the frequency, measured in Hertz (1 Hz = 1 vibration per second). These vibrations enter the outer ear and cause the eardrum to vibrate too. The fastest vibration we can hear is 20,000 times per second, which would be a very high sound.</p><p></p><p>10. The sensation of sound by a listener does not require vibration. The effects of turbulence (wind for example) on listeners, is often called pseudo-sound. Turbulence in the medium creates pressure fluctuations that do not travel as waves.</p><br />

                            23. TRUE OR FALSE 13. Distance gives complete information of the route followed by the body, while displacement does not give complete information of the route followed by the body. 14. Distance is always positive, cannot be negative and zero. 15. The unit used to express speed is meters per second (m/s), it can also be expressed in miles per hour (mi/hr or mph), kilometers per hour (km/hr or kph). 16. In calculating for average speed, you will divide the total distance travelled by the total time travelled. 17. The unit used for velocity is the same as the unit of speed like meter per second, kilometer per hour, and miles per hour. 18. If you are not changing your speed, and you are not changing your direction, then you simply cannot be accelerating, no matter how fast you are going. 19. Time is plotted on the Y-axis, while distance is plotted on the X-axis. 20. A speed-time graph shows how the speed of a moving object changes with time. 21. Speed-time graph is different from velocity-time graph. 22. In a given time, if the distance the object moves is changed (getting larger), it is accelerating. 23. A straight horizontal line on a speed-time graph means that speed is constant. It is not changing over time. Therefore, it has no acceleration. 24. A downward sloping line means that the object is slowing down. 25. A horizontal line means the object is moving at a constant speed with zero acceleration. MIT​</h2><br />

1. An athlete run over the oval 4 laps every morning. If the athlete ideally has stopped from where he/she started, his/her displacement is zero. 
2. If you want to know how fast the man is going then you are referring to his velocity.
3. A car is travelling along a straight line path covered 20 meters in just 5 seconds, so the calculated speed of the car is 20.5 m/s.
4. A moving object in a circular path with a constant speed is said to be accelerating.
5. If you encounter 9.8 m/s², this means the speed is increasing by 9.8 m/s every second.</h2><br />
                        #BrainlyFast<p></p><p>1. An athlete run over the oval 4 laps every morning. If the athlete ideally has stopped from where he/she started, his/her displacement is zero.</p><strong>TRUE</strong>Displacement is the shortest distance from the reference point to the stopping point. If you stop on the same place of the reference point, then the displacement is zero.
<p>
</p><p>2. If you want to know how fast the man is going then you are referring to his velocity.</p><strong>FALSE</strong>If you only want to know how fast the man is going without direction, then you have to find the speed not velocity.
<p>
</p><p>3. A car is travelling along a straight line path covered 20 meters in just 5 seconds, so the calculated speed of the car is 20.5 m/s.
</p><strong>FALSE</strong>20 m / 5 s = <strong>4 m/s </strong>not 20.5 m/s
<p>4. A moving object in a circular path with a constant speed is said to be accelerating.
</p><strong>TRUE</strong>Moving in a circular motion changes the velocity which also changes the acceleration of the object.
<p>5. If you encounter 9.8 m/s², this means the speed is increasing by 9.8 m/s every second.</p><strong>TRUE</strong>There will be an increased in speed of 9.8 m/s every second<p></p><p>Kindly visit the link below:</p><p><strong>brainly.ph/question/11905743</strong></p><br />
