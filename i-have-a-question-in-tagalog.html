In that situation, those who remain dreaming ambitiously and wish to change the organization's mentality are called leaders. 1 A few days ago, I gathered all representatives from each sales branch and announced, "we will double our sales."

I have noticed that I am quite good in teaching people. I am the tutor in every studying session I do with my friends, except for Filipino subjects, where I ask them questions and elaborating the parts they were confused in, this way of studying also helps me remember better since my memory works best when I am physically speaking. Before reaching to education, I also thought about being a medical technologist or nursing but ultimately settled for education since my family does not have enough money for the other two. But now, since COVID-19 happened, it actually helped cement the decision of being a teacher.</a>

                                            Learning Task 3: Case Study
In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other
people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be
people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or another ethnicity. If you know someone
who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects. Since you are
not allowed to go out at present because of the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, look for someone who is
near to your place or whom you have contact with through social media.
Be guided with the following questions as you write your case study:
1. Describe the group of people that you chose. Who are they? What do they do? Where did they
come from? What do you know about them?
2. Discuss their way of life in terms of: a. Social organizations b. Language c. Religion d. Arts and
literature e. Economic systems f. Values, beliefs and traditions
3. Summarize what you have learned using the 3-2-1 chart below:
3 Things I learned from them
2 Things I found interesting
1 Thing I realize</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) Melody is a timely arranged linear sequence of pitched sounds that the listener perceives as a single entity. Melody is one of the most basic elements of music. A note is a sound with a particular pitch and duration. String a series of notes together, one after the other, and you have a melody.</p><p></p><p>2) constructive way to express who you are and what you are feeling, especially in young children. It can often be difficult for children to say how they are feeling, primarily because they don’t know the name of the feeling they’re experiencing and instead they show us by crying, throwing temper tantrums, or having meltdowns. Emotional expression is something that must be learned, and young children can be taught basic emotions such as happy, mad, sad, and scared as early as two years old.</p><p></p><p>3) Melodies are produced through the human voice and any other instrument that produces pitches––marimbas, flutes, synthesizers, glockenspiels, guitars, etc.</p><p></p><p>4) Dynamics effects alter the volume of sound (that is, attenuate it) once it crosses the threshold. The amount it attenuates the sound is called the ratio. The higher the ratio, the more the effect will attenuate the sound.</p><p></p><p>5) Learning a musical instrument not only sustains and feeds the brain, but it also improves so many other cognitive and physical aspects of the human body. It's been widely studied and proven that learning a musical instrument improves memory; it not only improves your cognitive memory but also muscle memory as well.</p><p></p><p>6) When we sing folk songs it connects us with the generations who have come before us as well as other cultures from around the world. We follow in their footsteps and gather together because of our love for singing and dancing. Folk songs are also great because they make it so easy to teach history and culture</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

I have noticed that I am quite good in teaching people. I am the tutor in every studying session I do with my friends, except for Filipino subjects, where I ask them questions and elaborating the parts they were confused in, this way of studying also helps me remember better since my memory works best when I am physically speaking. Before reaching to education, I also thought about being a medical technologist or nursing but ultimately settled for education since my family does not have enough money for the other two. But now, since COVID-19 happened, it actually helped cement the decision of being a teacher.</h2><br />

                            28. Learning Task 3: Case Study
In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other
people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be
people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or another ethnicity. If you know someone
who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects. Since you are
not allowed to go out at present because of the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, look for someone who is
near to your place or whom you have contact with through social media.
Be guided with the following questions as you write your case study:
1. Describe the group of people that you chose. Who are they? What do they do? Where did they
come from? What do you know about them?
2. Discuss their way of life in terms of: a. Social organizations b. Language c. Religion d. Arts and
literature e. Economic systems f. Values, beliefs and traditions
3. Summarize what you have learned using the 3-2-1 chart below:
