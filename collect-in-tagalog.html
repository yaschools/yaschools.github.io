Projects approved under Duterte breach P3 trillion, buoy recovery hope
The New Clark City, which spans 9,450 hectares, is being hailed as the country's first smart, green, and resilient metropolis. It is one of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's major initiatives. Israeli companies specializing in providing green technologies and digital applications are among the most recent visitors to New Clark City.
PROJECTS approved by the Duterte administration exceeded P3 trillion as of February 2021, according to data released by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda). Based on Neda Board approvals as of February 2021, approvals reached P3.8 trillion covering 91 infrastructure projects.
At the start of the Duterte administration, the government had aimed to spend P7 trillion to P8 trillion worth of projects to usher in the “golden age of infrastructure.” The top 10 projects approved by the Neda Board had a collective price tag of P2.78 trillion or 72.45 percent of the total approved by the Duterte administration in over four years of the President’s term.
The Unsolicited Proposal for the Bulacan International Airport Scheme, valued at P735.634 billion, is the administration's biggest project. The Department of Transportation will carry that out in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (DOTr).
The Bulacan International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan, is being built, operated, and maintained, and includes airport expansion (including a passenger terminal facility, airside and landside facilities), as well as an 8.4-kilometer tollway connecting to the North Luzon Expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.
The project’s new cost of P628.421 billion and change in scope was approved by the Neda Board; it will be funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) and undertaken by the DOTr. Another big-ticket approval was the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP)-Phase 1, to cost P356.974 billion, to be financed through ODA and also undertaken by the DOTr. The project is a 25.3-km subway, to run from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to FTI in Taguig then to Naia. Its components include civil works; electromechanical, signaling, and telecommunications systems; station facilities; depot facilities; land acquisition; and procurement of rolling stock.</a>

                                            HISTORY OF PAOMBONG The local legend has it that the name 'Paombong" was taken from the long pamboo tube called "bumbong" or "tukil which is used for collecting nipa sap. The practice of extracting nipa sap with bumbong made the town known as the town of many bumbongs. The local people claimed that the Spaniards who first visited the place were so amused with the bumbong that, after learning its name from the natives, they named the town after the container, a name which later evolved to Paombong, a In the middle of 1750s, Paombong grew in a modest community from what was once a cogon land inhabited by a handful of Tagalogs, as its first gobernadorcillo During the revolution against Spain, Paombong's coastal area, more specifically. barangays Masukol and Binakod, played a significant role in Philippine History being known encounter sites between Spanish soldier and Katipuneros, Maloleño General Isidoro "Matanglawin" Torres used to retreat with his troops to barangay Masukol and barangay Binakod to avoid the advancing Spanish forces Paombong is a third class partially urban munipality in the province of Bulacan, Philippines. Dubbed as the "Vinegar Capital of the Philippines", Paombong is famous for its vinegar extracted from the sap of sasa (nipa) thus the term "sukang Paombong" (Paombong vinegar) became known in Luzon and other part of the Philippines.

Projects approved under Duterte breach P3 trillion, buoy recovery hope
The New Clark City, which spans 9,450 hectares, is being hailed as the country's first smart, green, and resilient metropolis. It is one of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's major initiatives. Israeli companies specializing in providing green technologies and digital applications are among the most recent visitors to New Clark City.
PROJECTS approved by the Duterte administration exceeded P3 trillion as of February 2021, according to data released by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda). Based on Neda Board approvals as of February 2021, approvals reached P3.8 trillion covering 91 infrastructure projects.
At the start of the Duterte administration, the government had aimed to spend P7 trillion to P8 trillion worth of projects to usher in the “golden age of infrastructure.” The top 10 projects approved by the Neda Board had a collective price tag of P2.78 trillion or 72.45 percent of the total approved by the Duterte administration in over four years of the President’s term.
The Unsolicited Proposal for the Bulacan International Airport Scheme, valued at P735.634 billion, is the administration's biggest project. The Department of Transportation will carry that out in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (DOTr).
The Bulacan International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan, is being built, operated, and maintained, and includes airport expansion (including a passenger terminal facility, airside and landside facilities), as well as an 8.4-kilometer tollway connecting to the North Luzon Expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.
The project’s new cost of P628.421 billion and change in scope was approved by the Neda Board; it will be funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) and undertaken by the DOTr. Another big-ticket approval was the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP)-Phase 1, to cost P356.974 billion, to be financed through ODA and also undertaken by the DOTr. The project is a 25.3-km subway, to run from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to FTI in Taguig then to Naia. Its components include civil works; electromechanical, signaling, and telecommunications systems; station facilities; depot facilities; land acquisition; and procurement of rolling stock.</h2><br />

                            6. HISTORY OF PAOMBONG The local legend has it that the name 'Paombong" was taken from the long pamboo tube called "bumbong" or "tukil which is used for collecting nipa sap. The practice of extracting nipa sap with bumbong made the town known as the town of many bumbongs. The local people claimed that the Spaniards who first visited the place were so amused with the bumbong that, after learning its name from the natives, they named the town after the container, a name which later evolved to Paombong, a In the middle of 1750s, Paombong grew in a modest community from what was once a cogon land inhabited by a handful of Tagalogs, as its first gobernadorcillo During the revolution against Spain, Paombong's coastal area, more specifically. barangays Masukol and Binakod, played a significant role in Philippine History being known encounter sites between Spanish soldier and Katipuneros, Maloleño General Isidoro "Matanglawin" Torres used to retreat with his troops to barangay Masukol and barangay Binakod to avoid the advancing Spanish forces Paombong is a third class partially urban munipality in the province of Bulacan, Philippines. Dubbed as the "Vinegar Capital of the Philippines", Paombong is famous for its vinegar extracted from the sap of sasa (nipa) thus the term "sukang Paombong" (Paombong vinegar) became known in Luzon and other part of the Philippines.
