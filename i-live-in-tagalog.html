Vicki Baum's evocative historical novel recounts the lives of peasants and nobles in colonial Bali, reared against a backdrop of bloodshed and cultural invasion. Dutch imperialism brings upheaval and revolution to the beautiful island, and the Balinese rebel in what would become a powerful and poignant example of symbolic resistance. A Tale from Bali culminates with the historic Battle of Badung, in which thousands of Balinese soldiers, clothed in white and armed only with daggers, threw themselves upon the merciless efficiency of the Dutch guns.

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </a>

Ipinahahayag dito na mas iginugusto pa ni Corazon Aquino ang mamatay ng mayroong taglay na karangalan kaysa ang mamuhay sa isang buhay na walang saysay o kahulugan. Ang mensaheng nais ipahatid dito'y dapat sikapin nating mamuhay ng isang buhay na makabuluhan. Dapat iwasan nating mamuhay ng isang buhay na puno ng kayamutan. Dapat kumilos ng tama at mamuhay ng marangal. </p><br />

                        Kinailangang pagtibayin sa pamamagitan ng plebesito ang Saligang Batas ng 1935 dahil may ilang kailangang probisyon na dapat baguhin o mas bigyang pansin para sa ikabubuti ng mga Pilipino. Lalo na at mga Pilipino ang gumawa ng mga probisyong nakapaloob sa salitang batas na ito. Anumang pagsususog (amendment) sa Salaigang-Batas ay kailangang iharap sa mamamayan upang sila ang magpasya sa pamamagitan ng  isang referendum or plebisito.  <br /><br /><strong>Ang probisyong nauukol sa "Parity Rights" na isususog sa Saligang-Batas ng 1935 ay kailangan munang pagtibayin sa isang plebisito maipatupad.  Ang Parity Rights ay ang pagbibigay ng kaparehong karapatan sa mga Pilipino at mamayang Amerikano sa paglinang at paggamit ng mga likas na yaman ng Pilipinas, produktibo man o hindi para sa ating bansa. </strong>  <br /><br />Ang probisyong ito  (Parity Rights) ay isa sa mga kondisyon ng pamahalaang Amerika sa pagtulong nila sa ating bansa na makabangon mula sa digmaan at sa masamang epekto sa ekonomiya ng pagkakasakop sa atin ng bansang Hapon.<br /><br />Ang <strong>pr</strong><strong>obisyong ito ay naratipika o naipasa sa plebisito noong Marso 11, 1947 </strong>kahit na may mga oposisyon sa mga nasyonalistang senador noong panahong iyon.<br />

Vicki Baum's evocative historical novel recounts the lives of peasants and nobles in colonial Bali, reared against a backdrop of bloodshed and cultural invasion. Dutch imperialism brings upheaval and revolution to the beautiful island, and the Balinese rebel in what would become a powerful and poignant example of symbolic resistance. A Tale from Bali culminates with the historic Battle of Badung, in which thousands of Balinese soldiers, clothed in white and armed only with daggers, threw themselves upon the merciless efficiency of the Dutch guns.

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Noong unang panahon, ang mga diyos lamang ang nabubuhay sa mundong ito, ang lupa, dagat, at langit ay pinamumunuan ng tatlong magkakaibang</p><p>makapangyarihang mga diyos. Ang diyos ng araw, na namuno sa langit, ay may isang napakagandang anak na babae, si Luna, ang buwan. Nag-enjoy si Luna</p><p>umiikot sa langit sakay ng kanyang gintong karo. Isang araw natagpuan niya ang kanyang sarili na tumahak sa ibang landas na humantong</p><p>sa labas ng kanyang kaharian. Naglakad-lakad siya hanggang sa marating niya ang lugar kung saan sinalubong ng langit ang dagat Maganda</p><p>at hindi pangkaraniwang tanawin ang sumalubong sa kanyang mga mata.</p><p>Habang hinahangaan niya ang mga magagandang bagay sa paligid, isang boses ang bumulaga sa kanya. Nagtanong ito, “Saan ka pupunta</p><p>galing sa pinaka maganda?" Paglingon niya ay nakita niya ang isang binata na kamukha ng kanyang ama</p><p>mas patas. Gusto niyang tumakas, ngunit nang muli siyang tumingin sa kanya, nakita niyang nakangiti ito sa kanya. Pagkuha</p><p>lakas ng loob niyang sumagot, "Ako si Luna, anak ng diyos ng araw." Ngumiti sa kanya ang binata at sumagot, “I</p><p>Ako si Mar, ang anak ng diyos ng dagat. Maligayang pagdating sa aming kaharian." Hindi nagtagal ay naging matalik na magkaibigan ang dalawa. Marami silang kawili-wiling kwento na sasabihin. Kapag oras na para sa</p><p>Luna to go, nangakong magkikita sila nang madalas hangga't maaari, dahil marami pa silang kwento sila</p><p>Nagpatuloy ang pagkikita sa iisang lugar hanggang sa napagtanto nilang in love na sila sa isa't isa.</p><p>Isang araw pagkatapos ng isa sa kanilang mga lihim na pagkikita, bumalik si Luna sa langit na puno ng kagalakan. Siya ay gayon</p><p>masaya na sinabi niya ang sikreto niya sa isa niyang pinsan. Ang pinsan, naninibugho sa kanyang kagandahan at kanyang kaligayahan, iniulat ang relasyon sa diyos ng araw. Nagalit ang diyos ng araw sa pagsuway ng kanyang anak sa imortal</p><p>mga batas. Isinara niya siya sa kanilang hardin at hindi siya pinayagang makalabas. Pagkatapos ay umuwi siyang malungkot. Sa tuwing naaalala niya si Mar, nagmamadali siyang lumabas sa ginto</p><p>kalesa patungo sa tagpuan sa pag-asang makita siyang muli. Ang mga mangingisda sa labas ng dagat ay naniniwala na sa bawat oras</p><p>Lumilitaw si Luna, ang buwan, nagugulo ang dagat. Si Mar ang sumusubok na tumakas sa kanyang kweba,” sabi nila.</p><br />
