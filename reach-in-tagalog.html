Projects approved under Duterte breach P3 trillion, buoy recovery hope
The New Clark City, which spans 9,450 hectares, is being hailed as the country's first smart, green, and resilient metropolis. It is one of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's major initiatives. Israeli companies specializing in providing green technologies and digital applications are among the most recent visitors to New Clark City.
PROJECTS approved by the Duterte administration exceeded P3 trillion as of February 2021, according to data released by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda). Based on Neda Board approvals as of February 2021, approvals reached P3.8 trillion covering 91 infrastructure projects.
At the start of the Duterte administration, the government had aimed to spend P7 trillion to P8 trillion worth of projects to usher in the “golden age of infrastructure.” The top 10 projects approved by the Neda Board had a collective price tag of P2.78 trillion or 72.45 percent of the total approved by the Duterte administration in over four years of the President’s term.
The Unsolicited Proposal for the Bulacan International Airport Scheme, valued at P735.634 billion, is the administration's biggest project. The Department of Transportation will carry that out in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (DOTr).
The Bulacan International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan, is being built, operated, and maintained, and includes airport expansion (including a passenger terminal facility, airside and landside facilities), as well as an 8.4-kilometer tollway connecting to the North Luzon Expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.
The project’s new cost of P628.421 billion and change in scope was approved by the Neda Board; it will be funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) and undertaken by the DOTr. Another big-ticket approval was the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP)-Phase 1, to cost P356.974 billion, to be financed through ODA and also undertaken by the DOTr. The project is a 25.3-km subway, to run from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to FTI in Taguig then to Naia. Its components include civil works; electromechanical, signaling, and telecommunications systems; station facilities; depot facilities; land acquisition; and procurement of rolling stock.</a>

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </a>

I have noticed that I am quite good in teaching people. I am the tutor in every studying session I do with my friends, except for Filipino subjects, where I ask them questions and elaborating the parts they were confused in, this way of studying also helps me remember better since my memory works best when I am physically speaking. Before reaching to education, I also thought about being a medical technologist or nursing but ultimately settled for education since my family does not have enough money for the other two. But now, since COVID-19 happened, it actually helped cement the decision of being a teacher.</a>

                                            What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</a>

                                            ano ang tagalog ng "Hrothgar is the King of the Danes in southern Denmark. Through success in battle he has become rich and mighty. As a symbol of his power and prosperity he builds a magnificent mead-hall, called Heorot, in which he and his loyal warriors can feast, drink, boast, and listen to the tales of the scops, the Anglo-Saxon bards. But soon after Heorot is finished, the mirth of the men and the music of the scop anger Grendel, a monster descended from Cain. Grendel raids the hall, snatching men and eating them, then returns to his home in the marsh. He repeats his nightly raids until no one dares sleep in the hall. Heorot, once the symbol of the Scyldings’ greatness, is now a place of shame and terror. This continues for twelve years, until Beowulf, a young warrior of the Geats in southern Sweden, hears about Grendel and, determined to fight the monster, sails to Hrothgar’s lands with fifteen companions.
 Hrothgar, who knew Beowulf’s father Ecgtheow, accepts Beowulf’s offer to fight Grendel and gives him a feast, though Beowulf and Unferth, a warrior loyal to Hrothgar, exchange insults. That night, the warriors sleep in Heorot, with Beowulf keeping watch. Grendel arrives and consumes one of the warriors, then reaches for Beowulf. Beowulf, famous for his powerful grip, which is as strong as the grip of thirty men, struggles with Grendel, tearing off the monster’s shoulder and arm. Grendel returns to the fens to die. His arm is hung as a trophy under the roof of Heorot.
 Hrothgar gives a second feast to celebrate Beowulf’s victory. At the feast, Hrothgar generously rewards Beowulf with treasure. The scop sings again, and Beowulf is praised until nightfall. That night, Grendel’s mother comes to the hall from her home in the bottom of a lake, seeking revenge for the death of her son. She grabs Aeschere, a favorite warrior and adviser of Hrothgar’s, and consumes him, then returns home. In the morning, the warriors follow her tracks to her lake, where they see Aeschere’s head. Beowulf enters the lake, and swims for hours before reaching her cave at the bottom. He fights with Grendel’s mother, but the sword Hrunting, which Unferth lent to Beowulf in a sign of fellowship, fails for the first time. From the treasure hoard in the cave Beowulf seizes a sword forged long ago by giants and kills Grendel’s mother. He sees Grendel’s body, and removes the head, and takes it and the hilt of the giant’s sword (the blade melted on contact with the monster’s blood) back to Hrothgar. 
There is another celebration in Heorot with more gifts and promises of friendship. Hrothgar says he feels like Beowulf is his son, and weeps at Beowulf’s departure. Beowulf and his men return to the land of the Geats, where his uncle the king, Hygelac, and Hygelac’s queen Hygd, greet Beowulf, accepting the treasure Beowulf gives them, and in turn rewarding Beowulf with a sword, praise, and land. Hygelac is eventually killed by the Swedes; his son Heardred, though young, takes the throne with Beowulf’s support. At Heardred’s death, Beowulf takes the throne of the Geats, and rules in great prosperity and fame for fifty years. 
 In Beowulf’s old age, a thief finds a passageway into an old barrow. Inside, a dragon guards a treasure trove left there long ago by the last survivor of an extinct people. The thief steals a cup, but the dragon discovers the theft and burns the land, including Beowulf’s mead-hall. Beowulf, knowing his death is near, decides to fight the dragon. Accompanied by his kinsman Wiglaf, ten warriors, and the thief, Beowulf sets out to confront the dragon. But when Beowulf and the dragon fight, all of Beowulf’s men flee except Wiglaf. With Wiglaf’s help Beowulf kills the dragon, but not before he himself is terribly wounded.
 Before he dies, Beowulf tells Wiglaf to rule after him, and to build him a funeral barrow that overlooks the sea. Wiglaf chastises the men for abandoning their lord. A messenger sent to tell the Geats of Beowulf’s death also warns of hard times for the Geats, now that Beowulf is dead. The Geats build a pyre and cremate Beowulf, then construct a barrow overlooking the sea, burying the dragon’s cursed treasure with him."</a>

Projects approved under Duterte breach P3 trillion, buoy recovery hope
The New Clark City, which spans 9,450 hectares, is being hailed as the country's first smart, green, and resilient metropolis. It is one of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's major initiatives. Israeli companies specializing in providing green technologies and digital applications are among the most recent visitors to New Clark City.
PROJECTS approved by the Duterte administration exceeded P3 trillion as of February 2021, according to data released by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda). Based on Neda Board approvals as of February 2021, approvals reached P3.8 trillion covering 91 infrastructure projects.
At the start of the Duterte administration, the government had aimed to spend P7 trillion to P8 trillion worth of projects to usher in the “golden age of infrastructure.” The top 10 projects approved by the Neda Board had a collective price tag of P2.78 trillion or 72.45 percent of the total approved by the Duterte administration in over four years of the President’s term.
The Unsolicited Proposal for the Bulacan International Airport Scheme, valued at P735.634 billion, is the administration's biggest project. The Department of Transportation will carry that out in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (DOTr).
The Bulacan International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan, is being built, operated, and maintained, and includes airport expansion (including a passenger terminal facility, airside and landside facilities), as well as an 8.4-kilometer tollway connecting to the North Luzon Expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.
The project’s new cost of P628.421 billion and change in scope was approved by the Neda Board; it will be funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) and undertaken by the DOTr. Another big-ticket approval was the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP)-Phase 1, to cost P356.974 billion, to be financed through ODA and also undertaken by the DOTr. The project is a 25.3-km subway, to run from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to FTI in Taguig then to Naia. Its components include civil works; electromechanical, signaling, and telecommunications systems; station facilities; depot facilities; land acquisition; and procurement of rolling stock.</h2><br />

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </h2><br />

                            11. What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</h2><br />

                        Tandaan na hindi mo pipiliin, pinipili ka ng pag-ibig. Lahat na maaari mong gawin ay tanggapin ito para sa lahat ng misteryo nito pagdating sa iyong buhay. Huwag mag-alala kung pinupuno ka sa pag-apaw. Pagkatapos ay umabot ka at ibalik ito. Ibigay ito pabalik sa taong nagdala nito sa iyo. Ibigay mo ito sa iba na mahihirap sa espiritu. Ibigay mo ito sa mundo sa paligid mo sa anumang paraan na maaari mong. Ito ay kung saan maraming mga nagmamahal ay nagkamali. Matagal na walang pagmamahal, nauunawaan nila ang pag-ibig tanging bilang isang pangangailangan. Nakita niya ang kanilang mga puso bilang walang laman na mga lugar na mapupuno ng pagmamahal, at nagsisimula silang magmukhang isang bagay, na dumadaloy sa kanila sa halip na para sa kanila. Ang unang pamumula ng pagmamahal ay napuno sa pag-aapoy, ngunit habang ang kanilang pag-ibig ay cools , nagbabalik sila sa pagtingin, ang kanilang pag-ibig bilang pangangailangan. Tiyak na maging isang taong gumagawa ng pag-ibig at sa halip ay maging isang taong naghahanap ng pag-ibig. Nakalimutan nila na ang lihim ng loveis, na ito ay isang regalo, na maaari itong gawin upang lumago lamang sa pamamagitan ng pagbibigay nito.<br />

                            27. ano ang tagalog ng "Hrothgar is the King of the Danes in southern Denmark. Through success in battle he has become rich and mighty. As a symbol of his power and prosperity he builds a magnificent mead-hall, called Heorot, in which he and his loyal warriors can feast, drink, boast, and listen to the tales of the scops, the Anglo-Saxon bards. But soon after Heorot is finished, the mirth of the men and the music of the scop anger Grendel, a monster descended from Cain. Grendel raids the hall, snatching men and eating them, then returns to his home in the marsh. He repeats his nightly raids until no one dares sleep in the hall. Heorot, once the symbol of the Scyldings’ greatness, is now a place of shame and terror. This continues for twelve years, until Beowulf, a young warrior of the Geats in southern Sweden, hears about Grendel and, determined to fight the monster, sails to Hrothgar’s lands with fifteen companions.
 Hrothgar, who knew Beowulf’s father Ecgtheow, accepts Beowulf’s offer to fight Grendel and gives him a feast, though Beowulf and Unferth, a warrior loyal to Hrothgar, exchange insults. That night, the warriors sleep in Heorot, with Beowulf keeping watch. Grendel arrives and consumes one of the warriors, then reaches for Beowulf. Beowulf, famous for his powerful grip, which is as strong as the grip of thirty men, struggles with Grendel, tearing off the monster’s shoulder and arm. Grendel returns to the fens to die. His arm is hung as a trophy under the roof of Heorot.
 Hrothgar gives a second feast to celebrate Beowulf’s victory. At the feast, Hrothgar generously rewards Beowulf with treasure. The scop sings again, and Beowulf is praised until nightfall. That night, Grendel’s mother comes to the hall from her home in the bottom of a lake, seeking revenge for the death of her son. She grabs Aeschere, a favorite warrior and adviser of Hrothgar’s, and consumes him, then returns home. In the morning, the warriors follow her tracks to her lake, where they see Aeschere’s head. Beowulf enters the lake, and swims for hours before reaching her cave at the bottom. He fights with Grendel’s mother, but the sword Hrunting, which Unferth lent to Beowulf in a sign of fellowship, fails for the first time. From the treasure hoard in the cave Beowulf seizes a sword forged long ago by giants and kills Grendel’s mother. He sees Grendel’s body, and removes the head, and takes it and the hilt of the giant’s sword (the blade melted on contact with the monster’s blood) back to Hrothgar. 
There is another celebration in Heorot with more gifts and promises of friendship. Hrothgar says he feels like Beowulf is his son, and weeps at Beowulf’s departure. Beowulf and his men return to the land of the Geats, where his uncle the king, Hygelac, and Hygelac’s queen Hygd, greet Beowulf, accepting the treasure Beowulf gives them, and in turn rewarding Beowulf with a sword, praise, and land. Hygelac is eventually killed by the Swedes; his son Heardred, though young, takes the throne with Beowulf’s support. At Heardred’s death, Beowulf takes the throne of the Geats, and rules in great prosperity and fame for fifty years. 
 In Beowulf’s old age, a thief finds a passageway into an old barrow. Inside, a dragon guards a treasure trove left there long ago by the last survivor of an extinct people. The thief steals a cup, but the dragon discovers the theft and burns the land, including Beowulf’s mead-hall. Beowulf, knowing his death is near, decides to fight the dragon. Accompanied by his kinsman Wiglaf, ten warriors, and the thief, Beowulf sets out to confront the dragon. But when Beowulf and the dragon fight, all of Beowulf’s men flee except Wiglaf. With Wiglaf’s help Beowulf kills the dragon, but not before he himself is terribly wounded.
 Before he dies, Beowulf tells Wiglaf to rule after him, and to build him a funeral barrow that overlooks the sea. Wiglaf chastises the men for abandoning their lord. A messenger sent to tell the Geats of Beowulf’s death also warns of hard times for the Geats, now that Beowulf is dead. The Geats build a pyre and cremate Beowulf, then construct a barrow overlooking the sea, burying the dragon’s cursed treasure with him."</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:"Si Hrothgar ang Hari ng mga Danes sa timog ng Denmark. Sa pamamagitan ng tagumpay sa labanan, siya ay naging mayaman at makapangyarihan. Bilang simbolo ng kanyang kapangyarihan at kasaganaan, siya ay nagtatayo ng isang kahanga-hangang mead-hall, na tinatawag na Heorot, kung saan siya at ang kanyang mga tapat na mandirigma Pansin, uminom, ipagmalaki, at pakinggan ang mga tale ng scops, Anglo-Saxon bards. Ngunit sa lalong madaling panahon matapos ang Heorot ay natapos, ang kagalakan ng mga tao at ang musika ng scop ng galit Grendel, isang halimaw ay nagmula mula kay Cain. ang bulwagan, kinuha ang mga lalaki at kumain sa kanila, at pagkatapos ay bumalik sa kanyang bahay sa bana. Inuulit niya ang kanyang mga gabiing pagsalakay hanggang sa walang sinuman ang makatutulog sa bulwagan. Si Heorot, minsan ang simbolo ng kalaking Scyldings, ay isang lugar ng kahihiyan at ito ay nagpapatuloy sa loob ng labindalawang taon, hanggang sa si Beowulf, isang batang mandirigma ng Geats sa timog Sweden, ay nakakarinig tungkol kay Grendel at, determinadong labanan ang halimaw, maglayag sa mga lupain ng Hrothgar na may labinlimang kasama.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Si Hrothgar, na nakakaalam ng ama ni Beowulf na Ecgtheow, ay tumatanggap ng alok ni Beowulf upang labanan si Grendel at binigyan siya ng isang kapistahan, bagama't si Beowulf at Unferth, isang matapat na mandirigma kay Hrothgar, nagbago ng mga insulto. Nang gabing iyon, ang mga mandirigma ay nakatulog sa Heorot, kasama ang Beowulf na nagbabantay. Si Grendel ay dumating at kumakain ng isa sa mga mandirigma, at pagkatapos ay umaabot sa Beowulf. Beowulf, sikat dahil sa kanyang malakas na mahigpit na pagkakahawak, na kasing lakas ng mahigpit na pagkakahawak ng tatlumpung lalaki, nakikipagpunyagi kay Grendel, lumubog sa balikat at braso ng halimaw. Nagbalik si Grendel sa fens upang mamatay. Ang kanyang bisig ay nakabitin bilang tropeo sa ilalim ng bubong ng Heorot.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Si Hrothgar ay nagbibigay ng pangalawang kapistahan upang ipagdiwang ang tagumpay ni Beowulf. Sa kapistahan, binigyan ni Hrothgar ng gantimpala ang Beowulf ng kayamanan. Ang scoping sings muli, at Beowulf ay praised hanggang sa takipsilim. Nang gabing iyon, ang ina ni Grendel ay dumating sa bulwagan mula sa kanyang bahay sa ilalim ng isang lawa, naghahangad ng paghihiganti para sa pagkamatay ng kanyang anak. Kinuha niya ang Aeschere, isang paboritong mandirigma at tagapayo ni Hrothgar, at kumakain sa kanya, pagkatapos ay bumalik sa bahay. Sa umaga, sinundan ng mga mandirigma ang kanyang mga track sa kanyang lawa, kung saan nakikita nila ang ulo ni Aeschere. Ang Beowulf ay pumasok sa lawa, at lumalangoy nang ilang oras bago maabot ang kanyang yungib sa ibaba. Siya ay nakikipaglaban sa ina ni Grendel, ngunit ang tabak na Hrunting, na Unferth lent sa Beowulf sa isang tanda ng pagsasama, ay nabigo sa unang pagkakataon. Mula sa hoard ng kayamanan sa yungib Beowulf ay sinamsam ang isang tabak na pinanghawakan ng mga higante at pinatay ang ina ni Grendel. Nakikita niya ang katawan ni Grendel, at inaalis ang ulo, at kinuha ito at ang sibat ng higanteng tabak (ang talim na natunaw sa pakikipag-ugnay sa dugo ng halimaw) pabalik sa Hrothgar.</strong></p><p></p><br />
