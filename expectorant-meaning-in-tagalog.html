                                            Text 2 Testimony of a Covid Patient (excerpt) Eugene,a 32-year old nurse, left the elderly care home early on April 1 eager to spend time with his wife and five-month old son at their newly built house just outside of Vienna. But on the way home, he felt something was not right. He began to feel fatigue, his throat scratchy and that nagging feeling that he could have contracted Covid-19 at his workplace. "I could not stomach the thought of infecting my wife and son," he says. Reaching home, he set up a tent out in their garden, and slept there to isolate himself. It was not an easy few days as spring had started, the temperature dropped at night. So did the symptoms setting in: dry and rough coughing 39% fever, his whole body aching, and chills despite wrapping himself in layers of sheets. His diagnosis was confirmed,"I felt chills down my spine will I die? What will happen to my family? Will I survive this?" he recalls describing how the symptoms got worse,like his lungs were being attacked. He could not breathe,his fever was fluctuating, and he lost his sense of smell and taste. Over a week, he treated his cough with expectorant and his fever with paracetamol, and doubled up liquids. On April 23 he felt the symptoms wane and two days later his official isolation period ended. Now, he is back to work, ready to pick up where he left off. "It did not kill me, and instead it has made me more resolute and compassionate," he says. Now, he uses his experience to lift the spirits of his patients, colleagues, and some friends who also contracted Cevid-19.​</a>

The pregnant woman with 28 + 5 weeks gestation developedcough and expectoration on January 26, 2020, and then had a fever on January27 with her body temperature fluctuating between 37.5°C and 37.8°C. She wasdiagnosed with common pneumonia and treated by oral cephalosporin at acommunity hospital for 3 days. Her pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scanon January 30, 2020 (29 + 2 weeks gestation) (Fig. 1) showed scatteredconsolidation and ground-glass shadow of both lungs and the blood routine testresults showed that her white blood cell count was 8.15 x 109/L, neutrophil ratiowas 78.6%, lymphocyte count was 1.08 x109/L, lymphocyte ratio was 13.3%, C-reactive protein was 99.67 mg/L, and hemoglobin was 115 g/L: At the same time,she was tested negative for influenza A and B virus antigens, Mycoplasmapneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Based on the criteria of COVID-19pneumonia in the New Coronavirus Prevention and Control Program (5th edition)released by the National Health Commission of China on February 3, 2020,[8] shewas diagnosed as a clinically confirmed case, so quarantine treatmentcombined with nebulized inhalation and oral cephalosporin was applied for her.Five days later (30 weeks gestation), her body temperature returned to normaland the symptoms such as cough and expectoration disappeared. Subsequently,the pharyngeal swab test of SARS-COV-2 revealed twice negative at acommunity hospital on March 5 and March 7, 2020 (34 + 4 weeks gestation). Thepulmonary CT scan on March 24, 2020 (37 weeks gestation) (Fig. 1) revealed thatmost of the lung lesions were absorbed.

                            16. Text 2 Testimony of a Covid Patient (excerpt) Eugene,a 32-year old nurse, left the elderly care home early on April 1 eager to spend time with his wife and five-month old son at their newly built house just outside of Vienna. But on the way home, he felt something was not right. He began to feel fatigue, his throat scratchy and that nagging feeling that he could have contracted Covid-19 at his workplace. "I could not stomach the thought of infecting my wife and son," he says. Reaching home, he set up a tent out in their garden, and slept there to isolate himself. It was not an easy few days as spring had started, the temperature dropped at night. So did the symptoms setting in: dry and rough coughing 39% fever, his whole body aching, and chills despite wrapping himself in layers of sheets. His diagnosis was confirmed,"I felt chills down my spine will I die? What will happen to my family? Will I survive this?" he recalls describing how the symptoms got worse,like his lungs were being attacked. He could not breathe,his fever was fluctuating, and he lost his sense of smell and taste. Over a week, he treated his cough with expectorant and his fever with paracetamol, and doubled up liquids. On April 23 he felt the symptoms wane and two days later his official isolation period ended. Now, he is back to work, ready to pick up where he left off. "It did not kill me, and instead it has made me more resolute and compassionate," he says. Now, he uses his experience to lift the spirits of his patients, colleagues, and some friends who also contracted Cevid-19.​</h2><br />

He suspected that he might have contracted the virus while at work and was worried about infecting his wife and young son. He set up a tent in his garden to isolate himself, but the symptoms soon began to set in, including dry and rough coughing, fever, body aches, and chills. He describes feeling like his lungs were being attacked and experiencing difficulty breathing.</p><p></p><p>Eugene treated his symptoms with expectorant and paracetamol, while doubling up on liquids. Over the course of a week, his symptoms began to wane and his official isolation period ended. He has since returned to work and uses his experience to help lift the spirits of his patients, colleagues, and friends who have also contracted Covid-19.</p><p></p><p>Eugene's testimony highlights the fear and uncertainty that many people experience when they contract Covid-19. He also emphasizes the importance of taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, such as isolating oneself and treating symptoms appropriately. Despite his difficult experience with the virus, Eugene has become more compassionate and determined to help others.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa brainlist po </p><br />

                            21. DISCUSSION:A 33-year-old pregnant woman, whose last menstrual period was July 9, 2019,experienced her early pregnancy smoothly. Before January 23, 2020, she wasdoing fine and was in normal condition. Her colleague's father was hospitalizeddue to confirmed coronavirus pneumonia at the end of December 2019, and thecolleague developed fever symptoms after taking care of his father in thehospital and was later confirmed with the sever acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by quantitative real time polymerase chain reactionfrom throat swab. The pregnant woman with 28 + 5 weeks gestation developedcough and expectoration on January 26, 2020, and then had a fever on January27 with her body temperature fluctuating between 37.5°C and 37.8°C. She wasdiagnosed with common pneumonia and treated by oral cephalosporin at acommunity hospital for 3 days. Her pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scanon January 30, 2020 (29 + 2 weeks gestation) (Fig. 1) showed scatteredconsolidation and ground-glass shadow of both lungs and the blood routine testresults showed that her white blood cell count was 8.15 x 109/L, neutrophil ratiowas 78.6%, lymphocyte count was 1.08 x109/L, lymphocyte ratio was 13.3%, C-reactive protein was 99.67 mg/L, and hemoglobin was 115 g/L: At the same time,she was tested negative for influenza A and B virus antigens, Mycoplasmapneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae.

Subsequently,the pharyngeal swab test of SARS-COV-2 revealed twice negative at acommunity hospital on March 5 and March 7, 2020 (34 + 4 weeks gestation). Thepulmonary CT scan on March 24, 2020 (37 weeks gestation) (Fig. 1) revealed thatmost of the lung lesions were absorbed.
