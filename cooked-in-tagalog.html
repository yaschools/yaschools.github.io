                                            Why The Sky is High (Tagalog myth)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on Earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was, therefore, his father's right hand man.  He was always helping with the work in the field, and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily.  In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility.  He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the cooking.  He also pounded the palay that his father and Ingat harvested.  Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name.  Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground.  Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual.   He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.   His anger added to his strength and desire to finish the work quickly.  So he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised.  In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.  When he finished pounding rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen, and that is why it is where it is today.1.	Who are the brothers?2.	Who was careful in everything he did?3.	How did Daskol do his work?4.	Did Daskol like the work of pounding rice? Yes or no?5.	Why did Daskol become irritated while pounding rice one day? Choose the letter only.a.	He did not like doing the pounding of rice.b.	He was not paid for the work.c.	Every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.d.	He had to pound a greater quantity of palay.​</a>

Hello, my name is Frances Gracy H. Beslig and today I will show you how to cook a air fryer pork adobo . First of all before I will show you how to cook a air fryer pork adobo, I will tell you the different kinds of organism that is found in our front yard: Ants or langgam in tagalog ,birds or ibon, snail or kuhol, and little frogs or maliliit na mga palaka. So moving on I will show you the ingredients we need.
So we need oil, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, pepper, pork, and soy sauce with onions and calamansi for dipping. After that we have to wash the utensils we need like plates. So the procedure is to: 
• Preheat the air fryer to 400°F. 
• In a large bowl, combine the oil, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. 
• Next, add the pork belly pieces to the oil mixture to coat each piece. 
• Then, in a single layer, place the pork belly cubes in the air fryer basket. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook them in batches. 
Cook the pork belly bites for 20 minutes, shaking and flipping them a couple of times throughout the air-frying time. You can always cook them longer if you want them crispier or more done. 
• Remove the bites from the air fryer and serve warm.</a>

                            6. Why The Sky is High (Tagalog myth)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on Earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was, therefore, his father's right hand man.  He was always helping with the work in the field, and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily.  In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility.  He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the cooking.  He also pounded the palay that his father and Ingat harvested.  Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name.  Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground.  Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual.   He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.   His anger added to his strength and desire to finish the work quickly.  So he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised.  In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.  When he finished pounding rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen, and that is why it is where it is today.1.	Who are the brothers?2.	Who was careful in everything he did?3.

Hello, my name is Frances Gracy H. Beslig and today I will show you how to cook a air fryer pork adobo . First of all before I will show you how to cook a air fryer pork adobo, I will tell you the different kinds of organism that is found in our front yard: Ants or langgam in tagalog ,birds or ibon, snail or kuhol, and little frogs or maliliit na mga palaka. So moving on I will show you the ingredients we need.
So we need oil, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, pepper, pork, and soy sauce with onions and calamansi for dipping. After that we have to wash the utensils we need like plates. So the procedure is to: 
• Preheat the air fryer to 400°F. 
• In a large bowl, combine the oil, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. 
• Next, add the pork belly pieces to the oil mixture to coat each piece. 
• Then, in a single layer, place the pork belly cubes in the air fryer basket. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook them in batches. 
Cook the pork belly bites for 20 minutes, shaking and flipping them a couple of times throughout the air-frying time. You can always cook them longer if you want them crispier or more done. 
• Remove the bites from the air fryer and serve warm.</h2><br />
