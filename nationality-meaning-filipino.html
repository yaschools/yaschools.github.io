                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The Philippines is a culture in which East meets West. The Filipino people have a distinct Asian background, with a strong Western tradition. The modern Filipino culture developed through influence from Chinease traders, Spanish conquistadors, and American rulers.</p><p></p><p>2.Filipino people tend to be very hospitable, especially to Western visitors (1). Because of their strong ties to Spanish culture, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian (1). ... The family is the basic and most important aspect of Filipino culture.</p><p></p><p>3.We begin to learn our culture—the ways of our society—just after birth. That process is called socialization, and it involves far more than schooling. Our culture shapes the way we work and play, and it makes a difference in how we view ourselves and others. It affects our values—what we consider right and wrong. This is how the society we live in influences our choices. But our choices can also influence others and ultimately help shape our society.</p><p></p><p>4.It influences their views, their values, their humor, their hopes, their loyalties, and their worries and fears.
