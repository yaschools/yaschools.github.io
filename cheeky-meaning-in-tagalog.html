Peter the Policeman
One sunny day, Peter the Policeman was eating his lunch in the city park.
Suddenly, he looked up and saw a monkey stealing a bunch of bananas from
the nearby fruit shop. Peter the Policeman threw down his sandwich and ran after the
cheeky monkey, calling his other police friends on the radio for backup. Soon, the
monkey was surrounded by Peter the Policeman and his other police friends. It had
nowhere to hide. Peter then discovered that the monkey was actually the famous
Fruit Shop Robber who had been stealing fruit from shops all over the city. Peter the
Policeman put the monkey in his police car. He turned on the sirens so that he could
quickly rush the monkey down to the police station for questioning. Later that week,
the chief police officer gave Peter the Policeman a special award for his great work.
Thank goodness he had captured the Fruit Shop Robber... the city was safe, at last!</a>

Peter the Policeman
One sunny day, Peter the Policeman was eating his lunch in the city park.
Suddenly, he looked up and saw a monkey stealing a bunch of bananas from
the nearby fruit shop. Peter the Policeman threw down his sandwich and ran after the
cheeky monkey, calling his other police friends on the radio for backup. Soon, the
monkey was surrounded by Peter the Policeman and his other police friends. It had
nowhere to hide. Peter then discovered that the monkey was actually the famous
Fruit Shop Robber who had been stealing fruit from shops all over the city. Peter the
Policeman put the monkey in his police car. He turned on the sirens so that he could
quickly rush the monkey down to the police station for questioning. Later that week,
the chief police officer gave Peter the Policeman a special award for his great work.
Thank goodness he had captured the Fruit Shop Robber... the city was safe, at last!</h2><br />
