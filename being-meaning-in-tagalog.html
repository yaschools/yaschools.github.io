1)How can you explain this? In tagalog
Mental Health
What is mental health?
Mental health is the psychological well-being of
a person. It is how a person thinks, feels, and acts to
cope with life. Good mental health makes you function
comfortably in the society. It denotes a sound state of
mind that allows you to face and accept realities in life.
2)How can you explain this? In tagalog
Emotional health is a component of mental health. If you are in control of your
thoughts, feelings, and behavior, you are emotionally healthy. It means that you can
deal positively with reality, regardless whether the actual situation is good or bad.
How you feel affects how you think and act. If you are happy, you feel relaxed
doing even the most difficult tasks, But if you are sad, tensed or worried, you cannot
think properly and may not be able to do or finish a task.</a>

                                            inequality in one variable. History of Carmona In the late 16th century, a Spanish colonial resettlement program was implemented across wide areas of what came to be known as the province of (EXAMPLE) CAVITE. The program was designed to integrate the Filipinos into the religious and political institutions of the Spaniards. (1)__________ was first established as a mission town in 1595. Together with the other mission towns in the province, it became one of the centers of religious and economic activities in the first centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Carmona used to be a barrio of the Mission Town of Silang. It was locally known as "(2)_____________ "", a tagalog word for plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. At that time, this barrio was just a small farming community with a very small population. As its population rapidly increased, religious and political separation from the town of Silang was later sought from Spain. Eventually, it became an independent municipality on February 20, 1857 by virtue of the Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de (5)__________ The name (3_______) was adopted as a sign of gratitude to the Spanish officials who influenced the Central Government at the time of separation of the barrio. With boundaries properly delineated and a church established, it started its own religious and political administration. The people of Carmona have actively participated in the revolution against the Spaniards. It also witnessed the Filipinos' resistance against the Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation, some of Carmona's prominent houses were used as Japanese headquarters while the hills became the stronghold of Filipino revolutionaries After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions or land conflicts.​</a>

cope with life. Good mental health makes you function
comfortably in the society. It denotes a sound state of
mind that allows you to face and accept realities in life.
2)How can you explain this? In tagalog
Emotional health is a component of mental health. If you are in control of your
thoughts, feelings, and behavior, you are emotionally healthy. It means that you can
deal positively with reality, regardless whether the actual situation is good or bad.
How you feel affects how you think and act. If you are happy, you feel relaxed
doing even the most difficult tasks, But if you are sad, tensed or worried, you cannot
think properly and may not be able to do or finish a task.</h2><br />
