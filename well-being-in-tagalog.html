Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</a>

Projects approved under Duterte breach P3 trillion, buoy recovery hope
The New Clark City, which spans 9,450 hectares, is being hailed as the country's first smart, green, and resilient metropolis. It is one of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's major initiatives. Israeli companies specializing in providing green technologies and digital applications are among the most recent visitors to New Clark City.
PROJECTS approved by the Duterte administration exceeded P3 trillion as of February 2021, according to data released by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda). Based on Neda Board approvals as of February 2021, approvals reached P3.8 trillion covering 91 infrastructure projects.
At the start of the Duterte administration, the government had aimed to spend P7 trillion to P8 trillion worth of projects to usher in the “golden age of infrastructure.” The top 10 projects approved by the Neda Board had a collective price tag of P2.78 trillion or 72.45 percent of the total approved by the Duterte administration in over four years of the President’s term.
The Unsolicited Proposal for the Bulacan International Airport Scheme, valued at P735.634 billion, is the administration's biggest project. The Department of Transportation will carry that out in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (DOTr).
The Bulacan International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan, is being built, operated, and maintained, and includes airport expansion (including a passenger terminal facility, airside and landside facilities), as well as an 8.4-kilometer tollway connecting to the North Luzon Expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.
The project’s new cost of P628.421 billion and change in scope was approved by the Neda Board; it will be funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) and undertaken by the DOTr. Another big-ticket approval was the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP)-Phase 1, to cost P356.974 billion, to be financed through ODA and also undertaken by the DOTr. The project is a 25.3-km subway, to run from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to FTI in Taguig then to Naia. Its components include civil works; electromechanical, signaling, and telecommunications systems; station facilities; depot facilities; land acquisition; and procurement of rolling stock.</a>

cope with life. Good mental health makes you function
comfortably in the society. It denotes a sound state of
mind that allows you to face and accept realities in life.

Emotional health is a component of mental health. If you are in control of your
thoughts, feelings, and behavior, you are emotionally healthy. It means that you can
deal positively with reality, regardless whether the actual situation is good or bad.
How you feel affects how you think and act. If you are happy, you feel relaxed
doing even the most difficult tasks, But if you are sad, tensed or worried, you cannot
think properly and may not be able to do or finish a task.</a>

Actually, the Paombong word was derived from bumbong (a container made of bamboo). The old way of fermenting the vinegar (suka) was through this container. Sukang Paombong is one of the well-known products of Bulacan. Paombong has a vast plantation of sasâ or nipa palm. This plant is usually found along the estuary where salt water and fresh water flow. From its matured (bungang sasa) nipa palm fruits, these fruits are being spurned for one week to produce more juice and it is locally termed as pagsikad. First, tuba gatherers (manunubâ) used sharp knife to grate the end bent of the sasâ branch. Second, a bumbong will be used as the container of the sasâ juice when it comes out. Next, gathered sasâ juice will be transferred into a large container called "tapayan" (earthen jar) after two or three weeks of that process. Then, they will use a strainer to eliminate the dregs from the juice. Finally, after weeks of fermenting the vinegar in the container, sukang Paombong will be tasted and now is ready to be arranged right in your dining table.Tittle__________Author___________Setting___________Characters___________Event/s__________Theme_________nonsense report​</a>

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</h2><br />

It is one of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's major initiatives. Israeli companies specializing in providing green technologies and digital applications are among the most recent visitors to New Clark City.
PROJECTS approved by the Duterte administration exceeded P3 trillion as of February 2021, according to data released by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda). Based on Neda Board approvals as of February 2021, approvals reached P3.8 trillion covering 91 infrastructure projects.

The Unsolicited Proposal for the Bulacan International Airport Scheme, valued at P735.634 billion, is the administration's biggest project. The Department of Transportation will carry that out in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (DOTr).
The Bulacan International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan, is being built, operated, and maintained, and includes airport expansion (including a passenger terminal facility, airside and landside facilities), as well as an 8.4-kilometer tollway connecting to the North Luzon Expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.
The project’s new cost of P628.421 billion and change in scope was approved by the Neda Board; it will be funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) and undertaken by the DOTr. Another big-ticket approval was the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP)-Phase 1, to cost P356.974 billion, to be financed through ODA and also undertaken by the DOTr. The project is a 25.3-km subway, to run from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to FTI in Taguig then to Naia. Its components include civil works; electromechanical, signaling, and telecommunications systems; station facilities; depot facilities; land acquisition; and procurement of rolling stock.</h2><br />

A Sour Process                  Jon-Jon Surio Reyes Suka is the tagalog term for vinegar and Paombong is a place in Bulacan where earlier Spaniards named the town because of its huge area planted with bamboo. Actually, the Paombong word was derived from bumbong (a container made of bamboo). The old way of fermenting the vinegar (suka) was through this container. Sukang Paombong is one of the well-known products of Bulacan. Paombong has a vast plantation of sasâ or nipa palm. This plant is usually found along the estuary where salt water and fresh water flow. From its matured (bungang sasa) nipa palm fruits, these fruits are being spurned for one week to produce more juice and it is locally termed as pagsikad. First, tuba gatherers (manunubâ) used sharp knife to grate the end bent of the sasâ branch. Second, a bumbong will be used as the container of the sasâ juice when it comes out. Next, gathered sasâ juice will be transferred into a large container called "tapayan" (earthen jar) after two or three weeks of that process. Then, they will use a strainer to eliminate the dregs from the juice. Finally, after weeks of fermenting the vinegar in the container, sukang Paombong will be tasted and now is ready to be arranged right in your dining table.Tittle__________Author___________Setting___________Characters___________Event/s__________Theme_________nonsense report​</h2><br />

                        <strong>These are drugs that people use initially that may eventually lead to abuse of illegal drugs</strong><strong></strong><p>Addiction is a chronic condition defined by compulsive or difficult-to-control substance seeking and use, despite adverse effects. Most people make the decision to use <strong>drugs</strong> voluntarily at first, but chronic <strong>drug</strong> use can cause brain changes that test an addict's self-control and make it difficult to resist strong <strong>drug </strong>cravings. These brain alterations can last a long time, which is why <strong>drug </strong>addiction is referred to as a "relapsing" disease: people in recovery from <strong>drug </strong>use disorders are more likely to relapse after years of abstinence.</p><p>It's typical for people to relapse, but it doesn't indicate treatment isn't effective. Treatment, like that for other chronic illnesses, should be ongoing.</p><p></p><p>These are the drugs that people use initially that may eventually lead to abuse of illegal drugs.​</p><p>brainly.ph/question/9287973</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><p></p><p></p><br />
