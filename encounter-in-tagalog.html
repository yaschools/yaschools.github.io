                                            HISTORY OF PAOMBONG The local legend has it that the name 'Paombong" was taken from the long pamboo tube called "bumbong" or "tukil which is used for collecting nipa sap. The practice of extracting nipa sap with bumbong made the town known as the town of many bumbongs. The local people claimed that the Spaniards who first visited the place were so amused with the bumbong that, after learning its name from the natives, they named the town after the container, a name which later evolved to Paombong, a In the middle of 1750s, Paombong grew in a modest community from what was once a cogon land inhabited by a handful of Tagalogs, as its first gobernadorcillo During the revolution against Spain, Paombong's coastal area, more specifically. barangays Masukol and Binakod, played a significant role in Philippine History being known encounter sites between Spanish soldier and Katipuneros, Maloleño General Isidoro "Matanglawin" Torres used to retreat with his troops to barangay Masukol and barangay Binakod to avoid the advancing Spanish forces Paombong is a third class partially urban munipality in the province of Bulacan, Philippines. Dubbed as the "Vinegar Capital of the Philippines", Paombong is famous for its vinegar extracted from the sap of sasa (nipa) thus the term "sukang Paombong" (Paombong vinegar) became known in Luzon and other part of the Philippines.

                                            FOUR VALUES IN FILIPINO DRAMA AND FILMNicanor G. Tiongson(1) THERE IS NO doubt that cinema has risen as one of the most popular means ofmass communication in contemporary Philippines. Movie theaters dot cities, townsand other important commercial centers from Aparri to Jolo. Through thesetheaters, Nora Aunor has truly become a national figure and tagalog has risen tothe status of a real national language. Indeed, movie theaters have become asimportant to us today as churches were in the last century.(2) Because movies have become one of the most important means ofcommunication, it is high time that the Filipinos examined the values encounteredin and propagated by, the movies. These values at the general worldview arisingfrom them inevitably mold the Filipino's consciousness for better or for worse, in aneffective, if insidious, manner through stories that entertain.(3) Sad to say, the principal values encountered in most Filipino movies today arethe same negative values they have inherited from the traditional dramas whichmigrated, so to speak, from stage to screen, and provided the latter, for the longesttime, with both form, content and most of all, world-view. Four of these valueswhich we must single out for their prevalence, perseverance and perniciousnessmay ne encapsulated in the following statements: 1) Maganda ang Maputi (White isbeautiful), 2) Masaya ang may Palabas (Shows are the best), 3) Mabuti ang Inaapi(Hurrah for the Underdog!), and 4) Maganda pa ang Daigdig (All is Right with theworld)Comprehension Guide Questions: 3 points each1.

HISTORY OF PAOMBONG The local legend has it that the name 'Paombong" was taken from the long pamboo tube called "bumbong" or "tukil which is used for collecting nipa sap. The practice of extracting nipa sap with bumbong made the town known as the town of many bumbongs. The local people claimed that the Spaniards who first visited the place were so amused with the bumbong that, after learning its name from the natives, they named the town after the container, a name which later evolved to Paombong, a In the middle of 1750s, Paombong grew in a modest community from what was once a cogon land inhabited by a handful of Tagalogs, as its first gobernadorcillo During the revolution against Spain, Paombong's coastal area, more specifically. barangays Masukol and Binakod, played a significant role in Philippine History being known encounter sites between Spanish soldier and Katipuneros, Maloleño General Isidoro "Matanglawin" Torres used to retreat with his troops to barangay Masukol and barangay Binakod to avoid the advancing Spanish forces Paombong is a third class partially urban munipality in the province of Bulacan, Philippines. Dubbed as the "Vinegar Capital of the Philippines", Paombong is famous for its vinegar extracted from the sap of sasa (nipa) thus the term "sukang Paombong" (Paombong vinegar) became known in Luzon and other part of the Philippines.

The practice of extracting nipa sap with bumbong made the town known as the town of many bumbongs. The local people claimed that the Spaniards who first visited the place were so amused with the bumbong that, after learning its name from the natives, they named the town after the container, a name which later evolved to Paombong, a In the middle of 1750s, Paombong grew in a modest community from what was once a cogon land inhabited by a handful of Tagalogs, as its first gobernadorcillo During the revolution against Spain, Paombong's coastal area, more specifically. barangays Masukol and Binakod, played a significant role in Philippine History being known encounter sites between Spanish soldier and Katipuneros, Maloleño General Isidoro "Matanglawin" Torres used to retreat with his troops to barangay Masukol and barangay Binakod to avoid the advancing Spanish forces Paombong is a third class partially urban munipality in the province of Bulacan, Philippines. Dubbed as the "Vinegar Capital of the Philippines", Paombong is famous for its vinegar extracted from the sap of sasa (nipa) thus the term "sukang Paombong" (Paombong vinegar) became known in Luzon and other part of the Philippines.

                            28. FOUR VALUES IN FILIPINO DRAMA AND FILMNicanor G. Tiongson(1) THERE IS NO doubt that cinema has risen as one of the most popular means ofmass communication in contemporary Philippines. Movie theaters dot cities, townsand other important commercial centers from Aparri to Jolo. Through thesetheaters, Nora Aunor has truly become a national figure and tagalog has risen tothe status of a real national language. Indeed, movie theaters have become asimportant to us today as churches were in the last century.(2) Because movies have become one of the most important means ofcommunication, it is high time that the Filipinos examined the values encounteredin and propagated by, the movies. These values at the general worldview arisingfrom them inevitably mold the Filipino's consciousness for better or for worse, in aneffective, if insidious, manner through stories that entertain.(3) Sad to say, the principal values encountered in most Filipino movies today arethe same negative values they have inherited from the traditional dramas whichmigrated, so to speak, from stage to screen, and provided the latter, for the longesttime, with both form, content and most of all, world-view. Four of these valueswhich we must single out for their prevalence, perseverance and perniciousnessmay ne encapsulated in the following statements: 1) Maganda ang Maputi (White isbeautiful), 2) Masaya ang may Palabas (Shows are the best), 3) Mabuti ang Inaapi(Hurrah for the Underdog!), and 4) Maganda pa ang Daigdig (All is Right with theworld)Comprehension Guide Questions: 3 points each1.
