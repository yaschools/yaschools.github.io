Where did they come from? What do you know about them? 2. Discuss their way of life in terms of: a. Social organizations b. Language c. Religion d. Arts and literature e. Economic systems f.

In order to understand an unfamiliar culture, social scientists conduct researches. The best way to do this study is to experience that culture by living with people practicing it. Additionally, this experience should be done for a long period. In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or other ethnicity. If you know someone who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects.

Pagsasalaysay sa Napakinggang Balita 
Nakaumpok ang magkakaklaseng Allen, Pauline, Majen at Isabel sa playground ng kanilang paaralan. Hawak ni Allen ang pahayagang Tagalog at masusing binasa niya ang balita sa araw na iyon. 
Allen : Naku! tingnan ninyo ang headline ngayon. Nakapasok at naitala na raw sa ating bansa ang unang kaso ng bagong coronavirus. (Pasalaysay)___________________________________________ 
Pauline : Tama ka. Iyan din ang ulo ng balita sa telebisyon kagabi. Nagsasagawa na ng contact tracing o paghahanap sa mga taong nakasalamuha ng pasyente ang Kagawaran ng Kalusugan katuwang ang iba pang ahensya ng pamahalaan. Pinag-iingat na ang ating mga kababayan upang maiwasan ang pagdami ng kaso. 
(Patanong) _____________________________________________ 
Isabel : Ganyan din ang paksa sa napakinggan naming balita sa radyo. Inirerekomenda na ang pansamantalang pagtigil ng biyahe sa mga paliparan bilang pag-iingat sa banta ng corona virus. Binubuo na rin daw ang task group ng mga kinatawan na mamumuno dito. 
(Padamdam) ____________________________________________ 
Majen : Naglibot nga kagabi ang mga namumuno sa aming barangay. Nakiusap sila na kung maaari ay manatili na lamang kami sa loob ng aming tahanan lalo na kung walang mahalagang gagawin sa labas. (Pautos)________________________________________________ 
Allen : Talagang maugong ang balita ukol sa kumakalat na sakit na ito. Mahalagang sundin natin ang payo ng mga otoridad upang makaiwas tayo rito. Ang kalinisan ng ating kapaligiran at katawan gayundin ang pagkain ng masusustansyang pagkain ay makatutulong upang lumakas ang ating resistensya. 
Biglang lumapit sa kanila si Eric. 
Eric : (Pakiusap) ____________________________________________ Pinatatawag ang ating grupo ni Gng. Dionisio. Halika na kayo sa ating silid-aralan.

Main organ
Kalayaan (dated January 1896, published March 1896)[3][4]
Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities.

                                            Learning Task 3: Case Study
In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other
people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be
people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or another ethnicity. If you know someone
who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects. Since you are
not allowed to go out at present because of the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, look for someone who is
near to your place or whom you have contact with through social media.
Be guided with the following questions as you write your case study:
1. Describe the group of people that you chose. Who are they? What do they do? Where did they
come from? What do you know about them?
2. Discuss their way of life in terms of: a. Social organizations b. Language c. Religion d. Arts and
literature e. Economic systems f. Values, beliefs and traditions
3. Summarize what you have learned using the 3-2-1 chart below:

                                            ano ang tagalog ng "Hrothgar is the King of the Danes in southern Denmark. Through success in battle he has become rich and mighty. As a symbol of his power and prosperity he builds a magnificent mead-hall, called Heorot, in which he and his loyal warriors can feast, drink, boast, and listen to the tales of the scops, the Anglo-Saxon bards. But soon after Heorot is finished, the mirth of the men and the music of the scop anger Grendel, a monster descended from Cain. Grendel raids the hall, snatching men and eating them, then returns to his home in the marsh. He repeats his nightly raids until no one dares sleep in the hall. Heorot, once the symbol of the Scyldings’ greatness, is now a place of shame and terror. This continues for twelve years, until Beowulf, a young warrior of the Geats in southern Sweden, hears about Grendel and, determined to fight the monster, sails to Hrothgar’s lands with fifteen companions.
 Hrothgar, who knew Beowulf’s father Ecgtheow, accepts Beowulf’s offer to fight Grendel and gives him a feast, though Beowulf and Unferth, a warrior loyal to Hrothgar, exchange insults. That night, the warriors sleep in Heorot, with Beowulf keeping watch. Grendel arrives and consumes one of the warriors, then reaches for Beowulf. Beowulf, famous for his powerful grip, which is as strong as the grip of thirty men, struggles with Grendel, tearing off the monster’s shoulder and arm. Grendel returns to the fens to die. His arm is hung as a trophy under the roof of Heorot.
 Hrothgar gives a second feast to celebrate Beowulf’s victory. At the feast, Hrothgar generously rewards Beowulf with treasure. The scop sings again, and Beowulf is praised until nightfall. That night, Grendel’s mother comes to the hall from her home in the bottom of a lake, seeking revenge for the death of her son. She grabs Aeschere, a favorite warrior and adviser of Hrothgar’s, and consumes him, then returns home. In the morning, the warriors follow her tracks to her lake, where they see Aeschere’s head. Beowulf enters the lake, and swims for hours before reaching her cave at the bottom. He fights with Grendel’s mother, but the sword Hrunting, which Unferth lent to Beowulf in a sign of fellowship, fails for the first time. From the treasure hoard in the cave Beowulf seizes a sword forged long ago by giants and kills Grendel’s mother. He sees Grendel’s body, and removes the head, and takes it and the hilt of the giant’s sword (the blade melted on contact with the monster’s blood) back to Hrothgar. 
There is another celebration in Heorot with more gifts and promises of friendship. Hrothgar says he feels like Beowulf is his son, and weeps at Beowulf’s departure. Beowulf and his men return to the land of the Geats, where his uncle the king, Hygelac, and Hygelac’s queen Hygd, greet Beowulf, accepting the treasure Beowulf gives them, and in turn rewarding Beowulf with a sword, praise, and land. Hygelac is eventually killed by the Swedes; his son Heardred, though young, takes the throne with Beowulf’s support. At Heardred’s death, Beowulf takes the throne of the Geats, and rules in great prosperity and fame for fifty years. 
 In Beowulf’s old age, a thief finds a passageway into an old barrow. Inside, a dragon guards a treasure trove left there long ago by the last survivor of an extinct people. The thief steals a cup, but the dragon discovers the theft and burns the land, including Beowulf’s mead-hall. Beowulf, knowing his death is near, decides to fight the dragon. Accompanied by his kinsman Wiglaf, ten warriors, and the thief, Beowulf sets out to confront the dragon. But when Beowulf and the dragon fight, all of Beowulf’s men flee except Wiglaf. With Wiglaf’s help Beowulf kills the dragon, but not before he himself is terribly wounded.
 Before he dies, Beowulf tells Wiglaf to rule after him, and to build him a funeral barrow that overlooks the sea. Wiglaf chastises the men for abandoning their lord. A messenger sent to tell the Geats of Beowulf’s death also warns of hard times for the Geats, now that Beowulf is dead. The Geats build a pyre and cremate Beowulf, then construct a barrow overlooking the sea, burying the dragon’s cursed treasure with him."</a>

as of May 2000, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. 
From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in 
appearance and culture.2The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one.3The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.4The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.5Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.6The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia. Today, it is limited to the southern region of the country.9Christianity was introduced as early as the 16th century with the coming of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.10Protestantism was introduced by the first Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who arrived with the American soldiers in 1899.11Two Filipino independent churches were organized at the turn of the century and are prominent today. These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.

Pagsasalaysay sa Napakinggang Balita 
Nakaumpok ang magkakaklaseng Allen, Pauline, Majen at Isabel sa playground ng kanilang paaralan. Hawak ni Allen ang pahayagang Tagalog at masusing binasa niya ang balita sa araw na iyon. 
Allen : Naku! tingnan ninyo ang headline ngayon. Nakapasok at naitala na raw sa ating bansa ang unang kaso ng bagong coronavirus. (Pasalaysay)___________________________________________ 
Pauline : Tama ka. Iyan din ang ulo ng balita sa telebisyon kagabi. Nagsasagawa na ng contact tracing o paghahanap sa mga taong nakasalamuha ng pasyente ang Kagawaran ng Kalusugan katuwang ang iba pang ahensya ng pamahalaan. Pinag-iingat na ang ating mga kababayan upang maiwasan ang pagdami ng kaso. 
(Patanong) _____________________________________________ 
Isabel : Ganyan din ang paksa sa napakinggan naming balita sa radyo. Inirerekomenda na ang pansamantalang pagtigil ng biyahe sa mga paliparan bilang pag-iingat sa banta ng corona virus. Binubuo na rin daw ang task group ng mga kinatawan na mamumuno dito. 
(Padamdam) ____________________________________________ 
Majen : Naglibot nga kagabi ang mga namumuno sa aming barangay. Nakiusap sila na kung maaari ay manatili na lamang kami sa loob ng aming tahanan lalo na kung walang mahalagang gagawin sa labas. (Pautos)________________________________________________ 
Allen : Talagang maugong ang balita ukol sa kumakalat na sakit na ito. Mahalagang sundin natin ang payo ng mga otoridad upang makaiwas tayo rito. Ang kalinisan ng ating kapaligiran at katawan gayundin ang pagkain ng masusustansyang pagkain ay makatutulong upang lumakas ang ating resistensya. 
Biglang lumapit sa kanila si Eric. 
Eric : (Pakiusap) ____________________________________________ Pinatatawag ang ating grupo ni Gng. Dionisio. Halika na kayo sa ating silid-aralan.

Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</h2><br />

In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other
people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be
people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or another ethnicity. If you know someone
who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects. Since you are
not allowed to go out at present because of the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, look for someone who is
near to your place or whom you have contact with through social media.
Be guided with the following questions as you write your case study:
1. Describe the group of people that you chose. Who are they? What do they do? Where did they
come from? What do you know about them?
2. Discuss their way of life in terms of: a. Social organizations b. Language c. Religion d. Arts and
literature e. Economic systems f. Values, beliefs and traditions
3. Summarize what you have learned using the 3-2-1 chart below:

The prousness comes from the Spaniardin de thisintroduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and thisis what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Orientalone,By the Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizableby distinct traits and dialects – thesturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the centralplains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems ofMindanao. Tribal communities canbe found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.A Some 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain's lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and thesepeople can be found basically in Mindanao. The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christiandenominations and Buddhist.5 The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background ofthe people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of Americanrule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in theappearance and culture of the people of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.Let's skim!

                            15. ano ang tagalog ng "Hrothgar is the King of the Danes in southern Denmark. Through success in battle he has become rich and mighty. As a symbol of his power and prosperity he builds a magnificent mead-hall, called Heorot, in which he and his loyal warriors can feast, drink, boast, and listen to the tales of the scops, the Anglo-Saxon bards. But soon after Heorot is finished, the mirth of the men and the music of the scop anger Grendel, a monster descended from Cain. Grendel raids the hall, snatching men and eating them, then returns to his home in the marsh. He repeats his nightly raids until no one dares sleep in the hall. Heorot, once the symbol of the Scyldings’ greatness, is now a place of shame and terror. This continues for twelve years, until Beowulf, a young warrior of the Geats in southern Sweden, hears about Grendel and, determined to fight the monster, sails to Hrothgar’s lands with fifteen companions.
 Hrothgar, who knew Beowulf’s father Ecgtheow, accepts Beowulf’s offer to fight Grendel and gives him a feast, though Beowulf and Unferth, a warrior loyal to Hrothgar, exchange insults. That night, the warriors sleep in Heorot, with Beowulf keeping watch. Grendel arrives and consumes one of the warriors, then reaches for Beowulf. Beowulf, famous for his powerful grip, which is as strong as the grip of thirty men, struggles with Grendel, tearing off the monster’s shoulder and arm. Grendel returns to the fens to die. His arm is hung as a trophy under the roof of Heorot.
 Hrothgar gives a second feast to celebrate Beowulf’s victory. At the feast, Hrothgar generously rewards Beowulf with treasure. The scop sings again, and Beowulf is praised until nightfall. That night, Grendel’s mother comes to the hall from her home in the bottom of a lake, seeking revenge for the death of her son. She grabs Aeschere, a favorite warrior and adviser of Hrothgar’s, and consumes him, then returns home. In the morning, the warriors follow her tracks to her lake, where they see Aeschere’s head. Beowulf enters the lake, and swims for hours before reaching her cave at the bottom. He fights with Grendel’s mother, but the sword Hrunting, which Unferth lent to Beowulf in a sign of fellowship, fails for the first time. From the treasure hoard in the cave Beowulf seizes a sword forged long ago by giants and kills Grendel’s mother. He sees Grendel’s body, and removes the head, and takes it and the hilt of the giant’s sword (the blade melted on contact with the monster’s blood) back to Hrothgar. 
There is another celebration in Heorot with more gifts and promises of friendship. Hrothgar says he feels like Beowulf is his son, and weeps at Beowulf’s departure. Beowulf and his men return to the land of the Geats, where his uncle the king, Hygelac, and Hygelac’s queen Hygd, greet Beowulf, accepting the treasure Beowulf gives them, and in turn rewarding Beowulf with a sword, praise, and land. Hygelac is eventually killed by the Swedes; his son Heardred, though young, takes the throne with Beowulf’s support. At Heardred’s death, Beowulf takes the throne of the Geats, and rules in great prosperity and fame for fifty years. 
 In Beowulf’s old age, a thief finds a passageway into an old barrow. Inside, a dragon guards a treasure trove left there long ago by the last survivor of an extinct people. The thief steals a cup, but the dragon discovers the theft and burns the land, including Beowulf’s mead-hall. Beowulf, knowing his death is near, decides to fight the dragon. Accompanied by his kinsman Wiglaf, ten warriors, and the thief, Beowulf sets out to confront the dragon. But when Beowulf and the dragon fight, all of Beowulf’s men flee except Wiglaf. With Wiglaf’s help Beowulf kills the dragon, but not before he himself is terribly wounded.
 Before he dies, Beowulf tells Wiglaf to rule after him, and to build him a funeral barrow that overlooks the sea. Wiglaf chastises the men for abandoning their lord. A messenger sent to tell the Geats of Beowulf’s death also warns of hard times for the Geats, now that Beowulf is dead. The Geats build a pyre and cremate Beowulf, then construct a barrow overlooking the sea, burying the dragon’s cursed treasure with him."</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:"Si Hrothgar ang Hari ng mga Danes sa timog ng Denmark. Sa pamamagitan ng tagumpay sa labanan, siya ay naging mayaman at makapangyarihan. Bilang simbolo ng kanyang kapangyarihan at kasaganaan, siya ay nagtatayo ng isang kahanga-hangang mead-hall, na tinatawag na Heorot, kung saan siya at ang kanyang mga tapat na mandirigma Pansin, uminom, ipagmalaki, at pakinggan ang mga tale ng scops, Anglo-Saxon bards. Ngunit sa lalong madaling panahon matapos ang Heorot ay natapos, ang kagalakan ng mga tao at ang musika ng scop ng galit Grendel, isang halimaw ay nagmula mula kay Cain. ang bulwagan, kinuha ang mga lalaki at kumain sa kanila, at pagkatapos ay bumalik sa kanyang bahay sa bana. Inuulit niya ang kanyang mga gabiing pagsalakay hanggang sa walang sinuman ang makatutulog sa bulwagan. Si Heorot, minsan ang simbolo ng kalaking Scyldings, ay isang lugar ng kahihiyan at ito ay nagpapatuloy sa loob ng labindalawang taon, hanggang sa si Beowulf, isang batang mandirigma ng Geats sa timog Sweden, ay nakakarinig tungkol kay Grendel at, determinadong labanan ang halimaw, maglayag sa mga lupain ng Hrothgar na may labinlimang kasama.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Si Hrothgar, na nakakaalam ng ama ni Beowulf na Ecgtheow, ay tumatanggap ng alok ni Beowulf upang labanan si Grendel at binigyan siya ng isang kapistahan, bagama't si Beowulf at Unferth, isang matapat na mandirigma kay Hrothgar, nagbago ng mga insulto. Nang gabing iyon, ang mga mandirigma ay nakatulog sa Heorot, kasama ang Beowulf na nagbabantay. Si Grendel ay dumating at kumakain ng isa sa mga mandirigma, at pagkatapos ay umaabot sa Beowulf. Beowulf, sikat dahil sa kanyang malakas na mahigpit na pagkakahawak, na kasing lakas ng mahigpit na pagkakahawak ng tatlumpung lalaki, nakikipagpunyagi kay Grendel, lumubog sa balikat at braso ng halimaw. Nagbalik si Grendel sa fens upang mamatay. Ang kanyang bisig ay nakabitin bilang tropeo sa ilalim ng bubong ng Heorot.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Si Hrothgar ay nagbibigay ng pangalawang kapistahan upang ipagdiwang ang tagumpay ni Beowulf. Sa kapistahan, binigyan ni Hrothgar ng gantimpala ang Beowulf ng kayamanan. Ang scoping sings muli, at Beowulf ay praised hanggang sa takipsilim. Nang gabing iyon, ang ina ni Grendel ay dumating sa bulwagan mula sa kanyang bahay sa ilalim ng isang lawa, naghahangad ng paghihiganti para sa pagkamatay ng kanyang anak. Kinuha niya ang Aeschere, isang paboritong mandirigma at tagapayo ni Hrothgar, at kumakain sa kanya, pagkatapos ay bumalik sa bahay. Sa umaga, sinundan ng mga mandirigma ang kanyang mga track sa kanyang lawa, kung saan nakikita nila ang ulo ni Aeschere. Ang Beowulf ay pumasok sa lawa, at lumalangoy nang ilang oras bago maabot ang kanyang yungib sa ibaba. Siya ay nakikipaglaban sa ina ni Grendel, ngunit ang tabak na Hrunting, na Unferth lent sa Beowulf sa isang tanda ng pagsasama, ay nabigo sa unang pagkakataon. Mula sa hoard ng kayamanan sa yungib Beowulf ay sinamsam ang isang tabak na pinanghawakan ng mga higante at pinatay ang ina ni Grendel. Nakikita niya ang katawan ni Grendel, at inaalis ang ulo, at kinuha ito at ang sibat ng higanteng tabak (ang talim na natunaw sa pakikipag-ugnay sa dugo ng halimaw) pabalik sa Hrothgar.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            18. People and ReligionDepartment of Tourism1The Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish, and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million 
as of May 2000, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. 
From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in 
appearance and culture.2The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one.3The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.4The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.5Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.6The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia. Today, it is limited to the southern region of the country.9Christianity was introduced as early as the 16th century with the coming of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.10Protestantism was introduced by the first Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who arrived with the American soldiers in 1899.11Two Filipino independent churches were organized at the turn of the century and are prominent today. These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.
