Although we can see various pictures of Rhinoceros Beetle online, nothing can compare to seeing one up close and personal. From experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it's really impossible to get it off easily. The variety found in the Philippines is the Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle. They may seem formidable and vicious, but appearance can be deceiving. They have sharp claws and those claws can only hurt you if you get pinched by them. Other than that, they are practically harmless. They also have horns and there is a difference in length depending on whether it's a male or female. From what I understand, it's the strongest insect in the world. I'm not willing to test the assertion. 1. What are the names of the two types of beetles which are found in the Philippines? 2. What variety of beetles do those two types come from? 3. How did the author describe the claws of "uwang" and "salagubang"? 4. Do you think you will be hurt once you see an "uwang" or "salagubang" 5. What do you think is the purpose of the selection?​</a>

Ang mga industriya ng produksyon ay bumuo ng mga inalagaan na lahi ng kuneho (tulad ng kilalang angora rabbit) upang mahusay na punan ang mga kinakailangang ito.
</p><p>Ang mga leon ay may pangunahing papel sa kadena ng pagkain sa pamamagitan ng pagtulong upang makontrol ang populasyon ng halamang-gamot. Kung ang populasyon ng herbivore ay hindi kinokontrol, ang pagdaragdag ng kumpetisyon sa kanila ay maaaring maging sanhi ng pagkawala ng iba at sa gayon mabawasan ang biodiversity.

He is best known for his work in documenting the customs, beliefs, and practices of the Tagalog people, who are one of the major ethnic groups in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of Juan de Plasencia's work, which is known as the "Customs of the Tagalogs," was to provide a detailed description of the Tagalog way of life, including their social organization, religious practices, and cultural traditions. This information was intended to aid the Spanish colonizers in their efforts to convert the Tagalogs to Christianity, as well as to help them understand and govern the people they were colonizing.</p><p></p><p>In addition to his documentation of Tagalog customs, Juan de Plasencia also played a key role in establishing the first printing press in the Philippines, which was used to produce religious texts and other materials in Tagalog and other local languages. His work as a missionary and cultural historian has had a lasting impact on the Philippines, and he is remembered today as a pioneering figure in the country's history.</p><br />

                            20. 1 ,Why did Emilio Aguinaldo donate his house to the Philippine government?
2,What is the purpose of the topmost level of Aguinaldo’s house and how did this help them against the Spaniards?
3,We all know that the Aguinaldo Shrine was a witness in the declaration of the Philippine Independence on June 12, 1898 simultaneous with the waving of the first Philippine Flag and singing of the National Anthem, Marcha Nacional Filipina (Spanish) or Lupang Hinirang in Tagalog. Suppose that you witnessed that moment, what will be your feelings and will you be proud of what is happening? Why or why not?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Emilio Aguinaldo donated his house, which is now known as the Aguinaldo Shrine, to the Philippine government to serve as a symbol of his patriotism and his contribution to the country's struggle for independence. He wanted the house to become a national shrine that would remind Filipinos of their hard-won freedom and inspire them to uphold the values of liberty, democracy, and national sovereignty.</p><p></p><p>The topmost level of Aguinaldo's house served as a watchtower that allowed the Philippine revolutionary forces to monitor the movements of the Spanish troops in the surrounding areas. From this vantage point, the revolutionaries could detect any imminent threat and prepare their defenses accordingly. This helped them to mount a successful defense against the Spanish attack during the Battle of Alapan on May 28, 1898, which ultimately led to the hoisting of the Philippine flag.</p><p></p><p>If I witnessed the declaration of Philippine independence on June 12, 1898, I would feel overwhelmed with emotions of pride and joy. Witnessing the historic moment of a nation's birth and the culmination of a long and arduous struggle for independence would be a powerful experience. As an AI language model, I don't have feelings, but I can understand the significance of the event and appreciate the sacrifices made by the Filipinos who fought for their freedom. The declaration of independence represents the triumph of the human spirit over oppression and tyranny, and it is a reminder of the power of collective action in achieving a noble goal.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes.</p><p></p><p><strong>@</strong><strong>K</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>U</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>H</strong></p><p></p><br />
