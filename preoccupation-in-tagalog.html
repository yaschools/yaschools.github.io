                                            Directions: Read the short article and answer the questions that follow, The Impact of War on Children and Imperative to End War (An Excerpt) War affects children in all the ways it affects adults, but also in different ways. First, children are dependent on the care, empathy, and attention of adults who love them. Their attachments are frequently disrupted in times of war, due to the loss of parents, extreme preoccupation of parents in protecting and finding subsistence or survival for the family, and emotional unavailability of depressed or distracted parents. The child may be in substitute care with someone who cares for him or her only slightly-relatives or an orphanage. A certain proportion of war-affected children lose all adult protection - "unaccompanied children," as they are known in refugee situations. Citation: Santa Barbara, Joanna, "Impact of war on children and imperative to end war." Croatian medical journal 47, no. 6 (2006): 891-894. Directons: Read each item carefully and choose the letter of the correct answer. 1. What is the meaning of the word "disrupted" in the third sentence of the paragraph? Use context clues to get the right answer. “Their attachments are frequently disrupted in times of war, due to the loss of parents, extreme preoccupation of parents in protecting and finding subsistence or survival for the family, and emotional unavailability of depressed or distracted parents."

                                            The sling (A poem from South Africa) Roy Campbell Guarding the cattle on my native hill This was my taliman. Its charm was born. High in the blue and aquiline ozone, And by my tireless armourer, the rill, Smoothing his pellets to my hand or eye: And how its meteors sang into the sky The eagles of the Berg remember still. I wore this herdsma's bracelet all day long: To me it meant 'To-morrow' and 'Perhaps', The insults of Goliath, his collapse. Guided Questions: 1. Reflect on the meaning that you gave on Exercise 1, Does the word means the same on the poem? 2. What is the speaker's preoccupation? 3. Describe his talisman or his "lucky charm".

                            8. Directions: Read the short article and answer the questions that follow, The Impact of War on Children and Imperative to End War (An Excerpt) War affects children in all the ways it affects adults, but also in different ways. First, children are dependent on the care, empathy, and attention of adults who love them. Their attachments are frequently disrupted in times of war, due to the loss of parents, extreme preoccupation of parents in protecting and finding subsistence or survival for the family, and emotional unavailability of depressed or distracted parents. The child may be in substitute care with someone who cares for him or her only slightly-relatives or an orphanage. A certain proportion of war-affected children lose all adult protection - "unaccompanied children," as they are known in refugee situations. Citation: Santa Barbara, Joanna, "Impact of war on children and imperative to end war." Croatian medical journal 47, no. 6 (2006): 891-894. Directons: Read each item carefully and choose the letter of the correct answer. 1. What is the meaning of the word "disrupted" in the third sentence of the paragraph? Use context clues to get the right answer. “Their attachments are frequently disrupted in times of war, due to the loss of parents, extreme preoccupation of parents in protecting and finding subsistence or survival for the family, and emotional unavailability of depressed or distracted parents."

                            21. If the findings were gathered from the minority of the population, it is impossible to establish its reliability and validity. Why do you think so? What preoccupation of quantitative research is involved here?
Write 3-5 sentences .</h2><br />
                        <p>If the findings were gathered from only a minority of the population, it is impossible to establish its reliability and validity because the sample may not be representative of the entire population. If the sample is not representative, the findings cannot be generalized to the entire population, and there may be a bias in the results due to the group studied. This is related to the preoccupation of quantitative research with obtaining representative and random samples to increase the generalizability and accuracy of research findings. Therefore, quantitative research often uses statistical analysis to ensure that the sample is representative of the population and that the results are reliable and valid.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>2. A lot of women nowadays have so much more freedom than before, for example, they can play sports, be a president/prime minister, learn, win a noble prize, vote, they can be who they want to be and it's all because of Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone and Ida B. Wells they were the ones who protested on women's right to vote, Hélène de Pourtalès was the first ever woman to compete in the Olympics, and so many other women fought for each and every woman's life, we probably wouldn’t be here and live freely without these women. </p><p>3. </p><p>To me everyone has their own opinions on true crime, either it's because they want to know why those people commit such awful crimes, why these murders/crimes happen and how people go missing. Us humans always have the urge to know why, how, when, where or whatever happened because it sparks up our curiosity. Sometimes people watch/listen to true podcast because it may help them in the future, like what is dangerous and a lot more. </p><p>4.
