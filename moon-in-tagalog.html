powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </a>

                                            read it allWhy the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​</a>

                                            Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</a>

                                            The Origin of the Stars Tagalog Legend Hundreds of years ago, some people say there were no stars. The sun was a mighty god, ruler of the day. Buan, the moon, was a rival god of the sun and desired to rule both day and night. Lihangin, god of the wind, was a friend of both the sun and the moon. One day he went to visit Araw, god of the sun, to warm himself. When they were sitting together, Araw told Lihangin that he had bad feelings toward Buan. He said that he noticed him showing during the day. This meant that Baun desired to occupy a part of Araw's kingdom. Lihangin wanted them to be good friends. He told Buan not to occupy any part of Araw's kingdom. He said that Araw was fair and just, so Buan must be, too. The moon did not pay attention to his advice. He continued to shine during the latter part of the day and sometimes during the morning. Araw could not bear it. He told Buan not to do it anymore. Buan insisted. They had a quarrel. Buan was badly hit. Parts of his body were scattered around, and these became the stars, leaving the moon without its former light. Such was the origin of the stars. drawing http://seasite2.niu.edu/philippine-folk-tales/tagalog-myths-the-origin-of-the-stars/​</a>

                                            affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the Immortal Laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar has disobeyed the Immortal Laws. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves. Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of the cave, but he could not. He struggled so hard that he shook the walls of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar she would rush out in her golden chariot to the meeting place in the hope of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.  translate in tagalog​</a>

                                            Why the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the 
woman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation.

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </h2><br />

                            14. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</h2><br />

                            21. The Origin of the Stars Tagalog Legend Hundreds of years ago, some people say there were no stars. The sun was a mighty god, ruler of the day. Buan, the moon, was a rival god of the sun and desired to rule both day and night. Lihangin, god of the wind, was a friend of both the sun and the moon. One day he went to visit Araw, god of the sun, to warm himself. When they were sitting together, Araw told Lihangin that he had bad feelings toward Buan. He said that he noticed him showing during the day. This meant that Baun desired to occupy a part of Araw's kingdom. Lihangin wanted them to be good friends. He told Buan not to occupy any part of Araw's kingdom. He said that Araw was fair and just, so Buan must be, too. The moon did not pay attention to his advice. He continued to shine during the latter part of the day and sometimes during the morning. Araw could not bear it. He told Buan not to do it anymore. Buan insisted. They had a quarrel. Buan was badly hit. Parts of his body were scattered around, and these became the stars, leaving the moon without its former light. Such was the origin of the stars. drawing http://seasite2.niu.edu/philippine-folk-tales/tagalog-myths-the-origin-of-the-stars/​</h2><br />

Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar has disobeyed the Immortal Laws. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves. Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of the cave, but he could not. He struggled so hard that he shook the walls of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar she would rush out in her golden chariot to the meeting place in the hope of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.  translate in tagalog​</h2><br />

Ang diyos ng dagat, na nagalit din sa pagsuway ng kanyang anak, ay ikinulong siya sa isa sa kanyang mga kweba ng dagat. Nanatili si Luna sa hardin ng ilang oras. Nalungkot siya nang hindi makita si Mar. Nais niyang makasama itong muli. Pakiramdam niya ay hindi mapakali isang araw, nakatakas siya mula sa hardin. Kinuha niya ang kanyang gintong karwahe at nagmamadaling pumunta sa kanilang tagpuan. Nakita ni Mar, na nakakulong sa kweba ng dagat, ang kanyang repleksyon sa tubig. Gusto niyang lumabas para salubungin siya. Sinubukan niyang makaalis sa kweba, ngunit hindi niya magawa. Nagpumiglas siya kaya niyanig niya ang mga dingding ng kanyang kweba na nagdulot ng kaguluhan sa dagat. Hinintay ni Luna na lumitaw si Mar, ngunit hindi siya dumating. Pagkatapos ay umuwi siyang malungkot. Sa tuwing naaalala niya si Mar ay nagmamadali siyang papalabas sa kanyang gintong kalesa patungo sa tagpuan sa pag-asang makita siyang muli.

                            30. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the 
woman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation.
