                                            Learning Task 2 Read "Where's the Patis?" by Carmen Guerrero Nakpil. As you read the selection, STOP when you see a dish illustration and answer the question. What is the great Filipino dream? Where's the Patis? Carmen Guerrero Nakpil A Filipino may denationalize himself but not his stomach. He may travel over the seven seas, the five continents, the two hemispheres and lose the savor of home, forget his identity and believe himself a citizen of the world. But he remains- gastronomically, at least, always c Filipino. For, if in no other way, the Filipino loves his country with his stomach. 2 Travel has become the great Filipino dream. In the same way that an American dreams of becoming a millionaire or an English boy dreams of going to one of the great universities, the Filipino dreams of going abroad. His most constant vision is that of himself as a tourist. * To visit Hongkong, Tokyo and other cities of Asia, perchance or to catch a glimpse of Rome, Paris or London or to go to America (even for only a week in c flyspecked motel in California) is the sum of all delights. 4 Yet having left Manila International Airport in a pink cloud of despedidas and sampaguita garlands and pabilin, the dream turns into a nightmare very quickly. But why? Because the first bastion of the Filipino spirit is the palate. And in all the palaces and fleshpots and skyscrapers of that magic world called "abroad there is no patis to be had Which international cities do Filipinos want to visit the most? 5 Consider the Pinoy abroad. He has discarded the barong tagalog or "polo" for a dark, sleek Western suit. He takes to the habiliments from Hongkong, Brooks Brothers or Savile Row with the greatest of ease. He has also shed the casual informality of manner that is characteristically Filipino. He gives himself the airs of a cosmopolite to the credit card born. He is extravagantly courteous (especially in a borrowed language) and has taken to hand- kissing and to plenty of American "D'you mind's?" How can you describe the "Pinoy" being in a foreign country?​</a>

Mahayana Buddhism
In the previous lesson, we have learned What according to the Buddha, the path to happiness starts from an understanding of the root cause of suffering. Just like a physician who diagnosed the sickness of human persons as "suffering" due to "craving," the Buddha prescribes a proactive course of treatment for the "sick" person through "Dharma." Part of the "treatment" is the "Eight-fold Path" which the "sick" person must practice through mindful thought and action. In this lesson, we shall discover another form of Buddhism which also originated from the teachings and examples of the Buddha but has taken a different course.</a>

as of May 2000, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. 
From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in 
appearance and culture.2The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers.

Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one.3The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao.

The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.5Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.6The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia. Today, it is limited to the southern region of the country.9Christianity was introduced as early as the 16th century with the coming of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.10Protestantism was introduced by the first Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who arrived with the American soldiers in 1899.11Two Filipino independent churches were organized at the turn of the century and are prominent today. These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.

The Philippines has a population of 70 million, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders evolved the people of a unique blend of east and west, both in appearance and culture, The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for are said to be taken from Malay forefathers. (2) The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16 century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one. (3) Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions. Each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayas from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. (4) Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 11l dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups Some 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain's lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and these people can be found basically in Mindanao. (5) The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christian demonstrations and Buddhist.​</a>

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</a>

The practice of extracting nipa sap with bumbong made the town known as the town of many bumbongs. The local people claimed that the Spaniards who first visited the place were so amused with the bumbong that, after learning its name from the natives, they named the town after the container, a name which later evolved to Paombong, a In the middle of 1750s, Paombong grew in a modest community from what was once a cogon land inhabited by a handful of Tagalogs, as its first gobernadorcillo During the revolution against Spain, Paombong's coastal area, more specifically. barangays Masukol and Binakod, played a significant role in Philippine History being known encounter sites between Spanish soldier and Katipuneros, Maloleño General Isidoro "Matanglawin" Torres used to retreat with his troops to barangay Masukol and barangay Binakod to avoid the advancing Spanish forces Paombong is a third class partially urban munipality in the province of Bulacan, Philippines.

The condition and limitations ofinfrastructure and limited land area as a place forprocessing and disposal of final waste become acommon problem in various regions in Indonesia. Thisoperational technique consists of :1. Storage is the initial stage in waste managementoperations. The storage is done to facilitate thecollection process. At this stage it can be donewaste sorting process. Waste sorting processcould be the determining point of theeffectiveness to next waste management system,while in many cities in Indonesia waste sortingprocess is carried out at temporary dump orfinal disposal [8] . Sorting organic waste can be
 Used as compost which is very good for plants
 whereas plastic waste can be reused or
 recycled  2. Collection, is a series of moving waste fromstorage to temporary dump. In general, the toolsused to collect are in the form of carts orgarbage rickshaws.3. Displacement, is the following step from thegarbage operational techniques where the wastein the temporary dump is then transferred to thetruck to be taken to the landfill or final disposal. 4. Transportation, is an important stage in wasteoperational techniques. The effectiveness andefficiency of transportation can be a benchmarkfor successful waste management. Delaying thewaste transportation causing increase the nextwaste loading and risk of disrupting theenvironmental comfort. Planning, evaluationand monitoring of facilities, routes andtransportation schedules are important.5. Final disposal / processing , is the end of wasteoperational techniques which is then the wastetreated with proper management and utilization.One of the waste management efforts that canbe done is by adding efective microorganisms(EM4) which affect the quality of compostmaturity which is better than the naturalcomposting process for in accordance withquality standards of mature compost [11].Principly, the final disposal is to destroy waste
as an effort to minimize environmentalproblems. In Indonesia, waste processingmethods include: open dumping , ContollLandfill, Sanitary Landfill, composting , and

Mahayana Buddhism
In the previous lesson, we have learned What according to the Buddha, the path to happiness starts from an understanding of the root cause of suffering. Just like a physician who diagnosed the sickness of human persons as "suffering" due to "craving," the Buddha prescribes a proactive course of treatment for the "sick" person through "Dharma." Part of the "treatment" is the "Eight-fold Path" which the "sick" person must practice through mindful thought and action. In this lesson, we shall discover another form of Buddhism which also originated from the teachings and examples of the Buddha but has taken a different course.</h2><br />

These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</h2><br />

PAKI EXPLAIN IN TAGALOG PO PLSS PARA PO SA REPORT KOThe operational technique in the waste managementsystem depends on the amount of waste that will betransported to landfills. The condition and limitations ofinfrastructure and limited land area as a place forprocessing and disposal of final waste become acommon problem in various regions in Indonesia. Thisoperational technique consists of :1. Storage is the initial stage in waste managementoperations. The storage is done to facilitate thecollection process. At this stage it can be donewaste sorting process. Waste sorting processcould be the determining point of theeffectiveness to next waste management system,while in many cities in Indonesia waste sortingprocess is carried out at temporary dump orfinal disposal [8] . Sorting organic waste can be
 Used as compost which is very good for plants
 whereas plastic waste can be reused or
 recycled  2. Collection, is a series of moving waste fromstorage to temporary dump. In general, the toolsused to collect are in the form of carts orgarbage rickshaws.3. Displacement, is the following step from thegarbage operational techniques where the wastein the temporary dump is then transferred to thetruck to be taken to the landfill or final disposal. 4. Transportation, is an important stage in wasteoperational techniques. The effectiveness andefficiency of transportation can be a benchmarkfor successful waste management. Delaying thewaste transportation causing increase the nextwaste loading and risk of disrupting theenvironmental comfort. Planning, evaluationand monitoring of facilities, routes andtransportation schedules are important.5. Final disposal / processing , is the end of wasteoperational techniques which is then the wastetreated with proper management and utilization.One of the waste management efforts that canbe done is by adding efective microorganisms(EM4) which affect the quality of compostmaturity which is better than the naturalcomposting process for in accordance withquality standards of mature compost [11].Principly, the final disposal is to destroy waste
as an effort to minimize environmentalproblems. In Indonesia, waste processingmethods include: open dumping , ContollLandfill, Sanitary Landfill, composting , and
