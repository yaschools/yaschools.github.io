A one-crust or single-crust pie is one where the only crust is along the sides and bottom of the pan. The crust usually folds out onto the rim of the pie plate but doesn't hang over it. Decorate the edge of this crust by "fluting" it, pinching the edge with your fingers to form scallop shapes or waves; press it with fork tines or another decorative pattern; or leave it plain.  To make a single crust, roll out the dough into a circle and place it in the pan, trimming the edge to match the plate's rim, perhaps a little larger; however, some pie crusts are actually phyllo dough, folded and placed in the pan. Some recipes call for pre-baked pie shells, when the crust is baked before adding the filling. This is called "blind baking."</a>

Projects approved under Duterte breach P3 trillion, buoy recovery hope
The New Clark City, which spans 9,450 hectares, is being hailed as the country's first smart, green, and resilient metropolis. It is one of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's major initiatives. Israeli companies specializing in providing green technologies and digital applications are among the most recent visitors to New Clark City.
PROJECTS approved by the Duterte administration exceeded P3 trillion as of February 2021, according to data released by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda). Based on Neda Board approvals as of February 2021, approvals reached P3.8 trillion covering 91 infrastructure projects.
At the start of the Duterte administration, the government had aimed to spend P7 trillion to P8 trillion worth of projects to usher in the “golden age of infrastructure.” The top 10 projects approved by the Neda Board had a collective price tag of P2.78 trillion or 72.45 percent of the total approved by the Duterte administration in over four years of the President’s term.
The Unsolicited Proposal for the Bulacan International Airport Scheme, valued at P735.634 billion, is the administration's biggest project. The Department of Transportation will carry that out in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (DOTr).
The Bulacan International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan, is being built, operated, and maintained, and includes airport expansion (including a passenger terminal facility, airside and landside facilities), as well as an 8.4-kilometer tollway connecting to the North Luzon Expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.
The project’s new cost of P628.421 billion and change in scope was approved by the Neda Board; it will be funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) and undertaken by the DOTr. Another big-ticket approval was the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP)-Phase 1, to cost P356.974 billion, to be financed through ODA and also undertaken by the DOTr. The project is a 25.3-km subway, to run from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to FTI in Taguig then to Naia. Its components include civil works; electromechanical, signaling, and telecommunications systems; station facilities; depot facilities; land acquisition; and procurement of rolling stock.</a>

ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project will provide food for 55.000 low-income families, informal settlers, and families who have lost their livelihoods due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

ADB has launched an emergency food provision program on 31 March, following the approval of the $5 million Rapid Emergency Supplies Provision technical assistance program. The grant is implemented under the Tagalog name Bayan Bayanihan, the well-known Filipino principle of sharing what one has with one's community.The program provides for essential food supplies to around 55,000 of the most vulnerable households in the National Capital Region and neighboring areas, affected by income losses for daily wage earners due to the enhanced quarantine to contain COVID-19. It will act as a 'bridge' support until ADB's large-scale cash transfer program is rolled out. The program has a collaboration platform to attract private sector and philanthropic contributions for its expansion.1. What is the newsflash about?2.

A one-crust or single-crust pie is one where the only crust is along the sides and bottom of the pan. The crust usually folds out onto the rim of the pie plate but doesn't hang over it. Decorate the edge of this crust by "fluting" it, pinching the edge with your fingers to form scallop shapes or waves; press it with fork tines or another decorative pattern; or leave it plain.  To make a single crust, roll out the dough into a circle and place it in the pan, trimming the edge to match the plate's rim, perhaps a little larger; however, some pie crusts are actually phyllo dough, folded and placed in the pan. Some recipes call for pre-baked pie shells, when the crust is baked before adding the filling. This is called "blind baking."</h2><br />
                        Ang isang crust o single-crust pie ay isa kung saan ang tanging crust ay nasa gilid at ilalim ng kawali. Ang crust ay kadalasang nakatiklop sa gilid ng plato ng pie ngunit hindi ito nakabitin. Palamutihan ang gilid ng crust na ito sa pamamagitan ng "fluting" ito, pinching ang gilid gamit ang iyong mga daliri upang bumuo ng mga hugis ng hugis o alon; pindutin ito ng mga tinidor ng tinidor o iba pang pampalamuti na pattern; o iwanan ito. Upang gumawa ng isang solong crust, palabasin ang kuwarta sa isang bilog at ilagay ito sa kawali, pinutol ang gilid upang tumugma sa gilid ng plato, marahil isang maliit na mas malaki; Gayunpaman, ang ilang pie crust ay talagang phyllo dough, na nakatiklop at inilagay sa kawali. Ang ilang mga recipe na tawag para sa pre-lutong pie shell, kapag ang tinapay ay inihurnong bago idagdag ang pagpuno. Ito ay tinatawag na "bulag na pagluluto."<br /><br /><br /><br />That's it..<br />

Projects approved under Duterte breach P3 trillion, buoy recovery hope
The New Clark City, which spans 9,450 hectares, is being hailed as the country's first smart, green, and resilient metropolis. It is one of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's major initiatives. Israeli companies specializing in providing green technologies and digital applications are among the most recent visitors to New Clark City.
PROJECTS approved by the Duterte administration exceeded P3 trillion as of February 2021, according to data released by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda). Based on Neda Board approvals as of February 2021, approvals reached P3.8 trillion covering 91 infrastructure projects.
At the start of the Duterte administration, the government had aimed to spend P7 trillion to P8 trillion worth of projects to usher in the “golden age of infrastructure.” The top 10 projects approved by the Neda Board had a collective price tag of P2.78 trillion or 72.45 percent of the total approved by the Duterte administration in over four years of the President’s term.
The Unsolicited Proposal for the Bulacan International Airport Scheme, valued at P735.634 billion, is the administration's biggest project. The Department of Transportation will carry that out in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (DOTr).
The Bulacan International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan, is being built, operated, and maintained, and includes airport expansion (including a passenger terminal facility, airside and landside facilities), as well as an 8.4-kilometer tollway connecting to the North Luzon Expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.
The project’s new cost of P628.421 billion and change in scope was approved by the Neda Board; it will be funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) and undertaken by the DOTr. Another big-ticket approval was the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP)-Phase 1, to cost P356.974 billion, to be financed through ODA and also undertaken by the DOTr. The project is a 25.3-km subway, to run from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to FTI in Taguig then to Naia. Its components include civil works; electromechanical, signaling, and telecommunications systems; station facilities; depot facilities; land acquisition; and procurement of rolling stock.</h2><br />
