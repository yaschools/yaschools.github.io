Other toxic mushrooms are as dull-looking as edible ones, but they have a much

EXPLAINER: ANIMALS ROLE IN HUMAN DISEASE by Amanda Leigh Mascarelli2013 *Nearly 75 percent of new, or emerging, infectious diseases in people were first spread by animals. indeed, half of all germs known to cause human disease come from other animals. Some sources were birds, bats and other types of wildlife. Livestock 1 and pet animals have spread many other diseases. Scientists refer to the infections that people pick up from animals as being zoonotic (ZOO-oh-NOT-ik). The germs and other infectious agents that cause these diseases are known as pathogens. Most are microbes2such as viruses or bacteria; others include fungi-even teeny-tiny worms and ticks. 3in zoonotic diseases, animals serve as a pathogen's host. Over time, some long-term hosts no longer become sickened. When a virus commonly lives inside an animal without harming it, that host is now called a reservoir. For instance, birds-especially ducks-have evolved into a natural reservoir for flu viruses. *Pathogens move among hosts continuously, explains Jonathan Epstein. A veterinary epidemiologist, he's a scientist who studies the spread of disease in animals. (He works at EcoHealth Alliance​</a>

                                            Philippines Finally Receives First Batch of COVID-19 Vaccine The Philippines launched its national coronavirus vaccination campaign Monday amid widespread public skepticism and a struggle to procure vaccines. Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, the director of the state-run Philippine General Hospital in Manlla, received the first dose of the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China- based Sinovac Biotech Limited. The doctor's inoculation came just hours after President Rodrigo Duterte greeted the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac donated by Beijing. The Philippines is the last Southeast Asian nation to receive a COVID 19 vaccine supply. The Duterte administration is aiming to vaccinate 70 million of its citizens, but some public opinion polls have revealed a resistance among most people due to uncertainty over the safety and efficacy of the CoronaVac vaccine. But Carlito Galvez, who is leading the Philippines' vaccine procurement efforts, urged his compatriots to get the first vaccine that becomes available. "Let's not wait for the best vaccine. There's no such thing," Galvez said in a speech at the Philippine General Hospital. "The best vaccine is the one that's safe and effective and arrives early." But just receiving vaccines has been an issue. An expected shipment of 525,600 doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine that was due Monday has been postponed due to supply problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the Pacific archipelago, sickening more than 576,000 people, including 12,318 deaths, the second highest in the region. President Duterte has vowed to ease some of the restrictions imposed to boost the Philippine economy once more vaccines are available. (Excerpt from VOA News, March 01, 2021) 1.

I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.There are things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor.At breakfast, I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, "Goodbye, Daddy!" and I frowned, and said in reply, "Hold your shoulders back!"Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road, I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles There were holes in your stockings I humiliated you before you boyfriends by marching you shead of me to the house Stockings were expensive - and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that son from a father!Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door "What is it you want?" I snapped. You said nothing but ran across in one tempestuous plunge and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither And then you were gone, pattering up the stairsWell, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you it was that I expected too much of youth I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own yearsAnd there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character The little heart of you was as big asthe dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good nightNothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt there ashamed!It is a feeble atonement, i know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer and laugh when you laugh I will bite my tongue when impatient words come I will keep saying as if it were a ritual "He is nothing buy a boy - a little boy!"am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby Yesterday you were in your mother's arms, your head on her shoulder I have asked too much, too much.1.What is the biggest regret of the father in the story?2.In your own opinion, why Father Forgets was the title of the story?​​</a>

EXPLAINER: ANIMALS ROLE IN HUMAN DISEASE by Amanda Leigh Mascarelli2013 *Nearly 75 percent of new, or emerging, infectious diseases in people were first spread by animals. indeed, half of all germs known to cause human disease come from other animals. Some sources were birds, bats and other types of wildlife. Livestock 1 and pet animals have spread many other diseases. Scientists refer to the infections that people pick up from animals as being zoonotic (ZOO-oh-NOT-ik). The germs and other infectious agents that cause these diseases are known as pathogens. Most are microbes2such as viruses or bacteria; others include fungi-even teeny-tiny worms and ticks. 3in zoonotic diseases, animals serve as a pathogen's host. Over time, some long-term hosts no longer become sickened. When a virus commonly lives inside an animal without harming it, that host is now called a reservoir. For instance, birds-especially ducks-have evolved into a natural reservoir for flu viruses. *Pathogens move among hosts continuously, explains Jonathan Epstein. A veterinary epidemiologist, he's a scientist who studies the spread of disease in animals. (He works at EcoHealth Alliance​</h2><br />

                            12. Philippines Finally Receives First Batch of COVID-19 Vaccine The Philippines launched its national coronavirus vaccination campaign Monday amid widespread public skepticism and a struggle to procure vaccines. Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, the director of the state-run Philippine General Hospital in Manlla, received the first dose of the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China- based Sinovac Biotech Limited. The doctor's inoculation came just hours after President Rodrigo Duterte greeted the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac donated by Beijing. The Philippines is the last Southeast Asian nation to receive a COVID 19 vaccine supply. The Duterte administration is aiming to vaccinate 70 million of its citizens, but some public opinion polls have revealed a resistance among most people due to uncertainty over the safety and efficacy of the CoronaVac vaccine. But Carlito Galvez, who is leading the Philippines' vaccine procurement efforts, urged his compatriots to get the first vaccine that becomes available. "Let's not wait for the best vaccine. There's no such thing," Galvez said in a speech at the Philippine General Hospital. "The best vaccine is the one that's safe and effective and arrives early." But just receiving vaccines has been an issue. An expected shipment of 525,600 doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine that was due Monday has been postponed due to supply problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the Pacific archipelago, sickening more than 576,000 people, including 12,318 deaths, the second highest in the region. President Duterte has vowed to ease some of the restrictions imposed to boost the Philippine economy once more vaccines are available. (Excerpt from VOA News, March 01, 2021) 1.

I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.There are things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor.At breakfast, I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, "Goodbye, Daddy!" and I frowned, and said in reply, "Hold your shoulders back!"Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road, I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles There were holes in your stockings I humiliated you before you boyfriends by marching you shead of me to the house Stockings were expensive - and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that son from a father!Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door "What is it you want?" I snapped. You said nothing but ran across in one tempestuous plunge and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither And then you were gone, pattering up the stairsWell, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you it was that I expected too much of youth I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own yearsAnd there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character The little heart of you was as big asthe dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good nightNothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt there ashamed!It is a feeble atonement, i know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer and laugh when you laugh I will bite my tongue when impatient words come I will keep saying as if it were a ritual "He is nothing buy a boy - a little boy!"am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby Yesterday you were in your mother's arms, your head on her shoulder I have asked too much, too much.1.What is the biggest regret of the father in the story?2.In your own opinion, why Father Forgets was the title of the story?​​</h2><br />
