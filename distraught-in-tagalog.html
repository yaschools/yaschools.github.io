                                            Weary and distraught, the women listened to the storm as it raged around the houses. The wind screamed and howled. It drove suddenly against the doors with heavy lurching. It tore at the straw ropes that anchored the thatched roofs to the ground. It rattled and shook the small windows. It sent the rain in narrow streams under the door, through the piled-up sacks, to form large puddles on the hard, stamped, earthen floors.

I continued to search further and found a tennis ball, just around the corner. It had chocolate chip cookie Crumbs on it! Who would have dropped short brown hairs on the floor and left Crumbs on a tennis ball? There was a trail of crumbs leading toward the back door, which was open.

                                            In olden times, on a faraway island of Palawan, there lived a cruel Sultan
who created a game for justice. The accused had to choose from two identical doors. One contained a beautiful suited lady for the man to marry, the other, a ferocious crocodile to devour them. The fate was to be decided by chance alone, and no one who knew of the placement behind the doors was allowed to inform him which to elect. The Sultan was highly satisfied with this system.
Now, the Sultan had a daughter, and he loved her very much. Dayang Marikit had fallen in love with one of her father's helper, and Sultan became so angry when he found out that he threw him in jail.
The Sultan searched for the most savage of crocodiles and the most beautiful maiden in all his land. No matter which door the young man selected, he would have the best that could be offered.
Dayang Marikit was distraught. Her love was either going to die, or be married to someone else! She has secretly bribed people to tell her who the
woman was, and it was someone who had tried to win over her love before, someone that Dayang Marikit deeply hated. The princess achieved something no one had before: She knew which fate was behind each door. She worked hard to learn the secret, using the power of her will and gold to secure it.
The day had come, and many had gathered. As the accused bowed to Sultan, he looked at the princess. He knew that she had found out where the crocodile and the lady were, and he asked with his eyes, "Which one?" She quickly lifted her hand to the right.
The young man approached the door on the right. He had no idea what was held inside, but either would make him unhappy. He only wanted the princess. He slowly opened the door.
Did the crocodile or the lady come out of the doorway? The princess
loved the young man, but she was also cruel like her father. The story stops exactly at the point at which the young man opens the door. It does not tell his fate.</a>

There are no ugly stones on the beach. But there is this stone that is full of ugly scars--large, grayish, black scars that seem imbedded in its very heart. Some of us are like this stone. We are scarred by our sufferings and heartaches. Looking closely at the stone, I notice whitish colors surrounding the blemishes, which somehow offset the gloom evoked by the black scars. I search my mind, "Do we have whitish colors of peace, faith, and fortitude that could sustain us through the vicissitudes in our lives?" The stone doesn't bury itself and its ugliness in the sand but instead, it lives among its peers, without shame or fear. Once more I peer into my mind, "When we are distraught by sufferings, do we wade through life carrying these scars without rancor in our hearts? Or do we hide in our shell of reclusion and lose all desires to realize our dreams and yearn to love and be loved again? Do we bury ourselves in the sandstorm of self-pity?"

                                            CASE STUDY 2 Contract Changes and Charges Cynthia R. Bernabe The on-site coordination on the day of the event was critical. With just three hours before the event, plans were being changed by the client who was distraught because of her failure to inform Kate, the event manager, about the changes she had in mind. The client begged Kate to help her the situation, "Please help me, and just charge me for all the changes including the damages. I'll settle with you after the event. I'm just really going crazy now!" The atmosphere was really getting chaotic because the client was driving the coordinators mad. Though Kate thought that the client's was driving the coordinators mad. Though Kate thought that the client's demands were insane, she had to remain focused and put order to this event that was getting topsy-turvy. With the help of her highly skilled team and reliable suppliers, the seasoned event manager was able to cope with the changes. The event team members are experts in troubleshooting so the event was delivered successfully. The client was so thankful to the team for saving the day and for producing a great event for her guests. She asked that her bill be sent to her the following day so that she may settle her account . The following day, Kate received a call from the client. "I received the bill and I'm just so shocked with all these additional charges. This is a horrendous amount. This is too much!" Kate was equally shocked with the client's reaction. She remained calm though she was beginning to feel irritated by the unreasonable protest of this client. The charges were justified but the client continued to argue and seemed to have completely forgotten about the successful event that was accomplished the day before. She also seemed to have lost her memory on how she had begged Kate just to help her with the changes that she had also committed to pay. GUIDE QUESTIONS 1. If you were the event manager, how would you resolve this conflict? 2. What caused this conflict? 3. How could this conflict be avoided? 4. What policies should be enforced to avoid being in this situation? Chapter Review Questions 1. Why is it important to develop an event budget? A contract? 2. What are some of the cominon budget items for a meeting? 3. How do you compute for a net income? 4. What are the components of a contract?​</a>

                                            The Farmer and the WellA farmer looking for a source of water for his farm bought a well from his neighbor. Theneighbor was cunning, though, and refused to let the farmer take water from the well. On askingwhy, he replied. "I sold the well to you, not the water", and walked away. The distraught farmerdidn't know what to do. So, he went to Birbal, a clever man and one of the nine courtiers of EmperorAkbar, for a solution.The emperor called the farmer and his neighbor and asked why the man was not letting the farmerdraw water from the well. The cunning man said the same thing again. "I sold the well, not thewater. So, he cannot take my water",To this, Birbal replied, "All that sounds fine to me. But if you have sold the water and the water isyours, then you have no business keeping your water in his well. Remove the water or use it all upimmediately. If not, the water will belong to the owner of the well".Realizing that he's been tricked and taught his lesson, the man apologized and left. 1). who bought a well from his neighbor? a. a doctorb. a teacher c. a farmerd. a carpenter2. how would you describe the neighbor whom he bought the well​</a>

                                            CASE STUDY 2Contract Changes and Charges Cynthia R. Bernabe The on-site coordination on the day of the event was critical. With just three hours before the event, plans were being changed by the client who was distraught because of her failure to inform Kate, the event manager, about the changes she had in mind. The client begged Kate to help her the situation, "Please help me, and just charge me for all the changes including the damages. I'll settle with you after the event. I'm just really going crazy now!" The atmosphere was really getting chaotic because the client was driving the coordinators mad. Though Kate thought that the client's was driving the coordinators mad. Though Kate thought that the client's demands were insane, she had to remain focused and put order to this event that was getting topsy-turvy. With the help of her highly skilled team and reliable suppliers, the seasoned event manager was able to cope with the changes. The event team members are experts in troubleshooting so the event was delivered successfully. The client was so thankful to the team for saving the day and for producing a great event for her guests. She asked that her bill be sent to her the following day so that she may settle her account . The following day, Kate received a call from the client. "I received the bill and I'm just so shocked with all these additional charges. This is a horrendous amount. This is too much!" Kate was equally shocked with the client's reaction. She remained calm though she was beginning to feel irritated by the unreasonable protest of this client. The charges were justified but the client continued to argue and seemed to have completely forgotten about the successful event that was accomplished the day before. She also seemed to have lost her memory on how she had begged Kate just to help her with the changes that she had also committed to pay. GUIDE QUESTIONS 1. If you were the event manager, how would you resolve this conflict? 2. What caused this conflict? 3. How could this conflict be avoided? 4. What policies should be enforced to avoid being in this situation?​</a>

It drove suddenly against the doors with heavy lurching. It tore at the straw ropes that anchored the thatched roofs to the ground. It rattled and shook the small windows. It sent the rain in narrow streams under the door, through the piled-up sacks, to form large puddles on the hard, stamped, earthen floors.

Marilyn is suffering from inoperable cancer. When alert, her pain is intense she cries and draws herself into a fetal position. Her family is distraught when the doctor has ordered continuous intravenous morphine sulfate at an accepted rate. Her family wants you to increase the rate so that Marilyn is kept under and completely oblivious to her condition.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>increasing the morphine intake will only cause Marilyn to possibly die. That is why following prescription is important. The parents might just be too lazy to deal with Marilyn when she is suffering. Honestly, I do not see how I am related to the family nor the doctor, so I'll just respect whatever decision they make. Whether to overdose Marilyn with drugs or minimize her suffering (juuuust a little) with the right intake of morphine. If she dies, tleast she died high. lol. </p><p>Why don't ya'll just ask marilyn wth she wants? </p><br />

The cookie was sitting on a plate on the kitchen bench when I walked out to answer the door. By the time I came back, it was gone! I remember that I signed for the package that was delivered at exactly 3:23 pm. I was distraught! I decided to search the kitchen for clues to find out who stole my scrumptious cookie. As I was looking around, I found some short brown hairs by the bottom of the bench, just below where my cookie had been sitting. I continued to search further and found a tennis ball, just around the corner. It had chocolate chip cookie Crumbs on it! Who would have dropped short brown hairs on the floor and left Crumbs on a tennis ball? There was a trail of crumbs leading toward the back door, which was open. The crumbs led down the back stairs and onto the grass. As I followed the trail.

                            15. In olden times, on a faraway island of Palawan, there lived a cruel Sultan
who created a game for justice. The accused had to choose from two identical doors. One contained a beautiful suited lady for the man to marry, the other, a ferocious crocodile to devour them. The fate was to be decided by chance alone, and no one who knew of the placement behind the doors was allowed to inform him which to elect. The Sultan was highly satisfied with this system.
Now, the Sultan had a daughter, and he loved her very much. Dayang Marikit had fallen in love with one of her father's helper, and Sultan became so angry when he found out that he threw him in jail.
The Sultan searched for the most savage of crocodiles and the most beautiful maiden in all his land. No matter which door the young man selected, he would have the best that could be offered.
Dayang Marikit was distraught. Her love was either going to die, or be married to someone else! She has secretly bribed people to tell her who the
woman was, and it was someone who had tried to win over her love before, someone that Dayang Marikit deeply hated. The princess achieved something no one had before: She knew which fate was behind each door. She worked hard to learn the secret, using the power of her will and gold to secure it.
The day had come, and many had gathered. As the accused bowed to Sultan, he looked at the princess. He knew that she had found out where the crocodile and the lady were, and he asked with his eyes, "Which one?" She quickly lifted her hand to the right.
The young man approached the door on the right. He had no idea what was held inside, but either would make him unhappy. He only wanted the princess. He slowly opened the door.
Did the crocodile or the lady come out of the doorway? The princess
loved the young man, but she was also cruel like her father. The story stops exactly at the point at which the young man opens the door. It does not tell his fate.</h2><br />

There are no ugly stones on the beach. But there is this stone that is full of ugly scars--large, grayish, black scars that seem imbedded in its very heart. Some of us are like this stone. We are scarred by our sufferings and heartaches. Looking closely at the stone, I notice whitish colors surrounding the blemishes, which somehow offset the gloom evoked by the black scars. I search my mind, "Do we have whitish colors of peace, faith, and fortitude that could sustain us through the vicissitudes in our lives?" The stone doesn't bury itself and its ugliness in the sand but instead, it lives among its peers, without shame or fear.

                            19. CASE STUDY 2 Contract Changes and Charges Cynthia R. Bernabe The on-site coordination on the day of the event was critical. With just three hours before the event, plans were being changed by the client who was distraught because of her failure to inform Kate, the event manager, about the changes she had in mind. The client begged Kate to help her the situation, "Please help me, and just charge me for all the changes including the damages. I'll settle with you after the event. I'm just really going crazy now!" The atmosphere was really getting chaotic because the client was driving the coordinators mad. Though Kate thought that the client's was driving the coordinators mad. Though Kate thought that the client's demands were insane, she had to remain focused and put order to this event that was getting topsy-turvy. With the help of her highly skilled team and reliable suppliers, the seasoned event manager was able to cope with the changes. The event team members are experts in troubleshooting so the event was delivered successfully. The client was so thankful to the team for saving the day and for producing a great event for her guests. She asked that her bill be sent to her the following day so that she may settle her account . The following day, Kate received a call from the client. "I received the bill and I'm just so shocked with all these additional charges. This is a horrendous amount. This is too much!" Kate was equally shocked with the client's reaction. She remained calm though she was beginning to feel irritated by the unreasonable protest of this client. The charges were justified but the client continued to argue and seemed to have completely forgotten about the successful event that was accomplished the day before. She also seemed to have lost her memory on how she had begged Kate just to help her with the changes that she had also committed to pay. GUIDE QUESTIONS 1.
