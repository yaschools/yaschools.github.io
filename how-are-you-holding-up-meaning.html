Looking over a cliff they saw some rare plants about twenty feet (six meters) below. The botanists turned to a young boy who had been watching them and said, "Boy, let us tie a rope around your waist and lower you to the ledge below. After digging up two plants, we will pull you up again. We will pay you for your trouble." The boy answered, "I will do it." However, he ran down the mountain to the valley below. Soon he returned with a man. "Sirs," he stated, "this is my father. If you will let him hold the rope, I will go down and get the plants for you." When Dr. John Paton was translating the New Testament into the language of the South Sea Islanders, he could not find a native word for "faith."

Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.use your conditionals in your answer." Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. "1. If social injustice had not existed, what would probably the experiences of his people? 2. What could possibly happen if their efforts to achieve democracy would generate physical violence in the process?" I say to you today, my friends, though, even though we face the difficulties of to- day and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the Ameri- can dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." 3.

What another allegory could then be attributed to bold ink and sharp colors in relation to the excerpt? Explain your answer. 3. Resilience is one of the values Filipinos are known for. How could we embody resilience despite oppression?pasagot po thank you :&gt;​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>1.</strong> Literally, the excerpt seems to describe a country that is struggling to progress or make progress, possibly due to various challenges or obstacles that it faces. The phrase "the country without miracles" suggests that this country may not have had many fortunate or unexpected events that have helped it improve its situation.</p><p></p><p><strong>2.</strong> One allegory that could be attributed to bold ink and sharp colors in relation to the excerpt is that they represent the powerful forces that resist change or progress. The use of bold ink and sharp colors implies that these forces are strong, vivid, and overwhelming, and they may include factors such as political corruption, social inequality, economic instability, or cultural conservatism. Just as bold ink and sharp colors hold down the country on the page, these forces hold down the country in reality, making it difficult for it to move forward.</p><p></p><p><strong>3.</strong> To embody resilience despite oppression, Filipinos can draw inspiration from their history and culture. Filipinos have a long tradition of resistance and struggle against colonialism, dictatorship, and other forms of oppression. They have used various forms of expression, such as music, art, literature, and social movements, to voice their grievances and demand change. To embody resilience, Filipinos can continue to speak out against injustice, support each other in times of need, and work together to create a more equitable and inclusive society. They can also draw strength from their cultural values, such as bayanihan (community cooperation), pakikisama (social harmony), and pagtitiis (patience and endurance), which have helped them survive and thrive in difficult circumstances.</p><br />

                            21. How does these stories illustrate the element of trust found in faith? Some English botanists once visited Switzerland to collect rare mountain flowers. Looking over a cliff they saw some rare plants about twenty feet (six meters) below.

Soon he returned with a man. "Sirs," he stated, "this is my father. If you will let him hold the rope, I will go down and get the plants for you."

As he dropped into a chair, he used a native word meaning, "I am resting my full weight here." Instantly, Dr. Paton grasped this word as the one he needed for "faith."

                            27. Learning Task 7: Read and analyze the excerpted lines taken from Martin Luther King's speech, I Have A Dream. The whole text may be accessed at https://www.american rhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm. Copy and answer the following in your notebook. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.use your conditionals in your answer." Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. "1. If social injustice had not existed, what would probably the experiences of his people? 2. What could possibly happen if their efforts to achieve democracy would generate physical violence in the process?" I say to you today, my friends, though, even though we face the difficulties of to- day and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the Ameri- can dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." 3. If you were given the chance to talk to King after his speech, what would you tell or ask him? 4. If you were King, would you dream the same thing for your country? Why or why not?" When we allow freedom ring - when we let it ring from every city and every ham- let, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, we will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual,Free at last! Free at last! Great God Almighty, We are free at last! " 5. For King, how does it feel to be free from discrimination and injustices? 6. What do you think will happen when Filipinos unite and respect differences?​</h2><br />
                        The African-American community would be able to exercise their rights and live lives that are not under discrimination and threat. They would be able to contribute greater to society because they are not being inhibited by hate and stigma from the community. The<strong> African - American culture </strong>would have an earlier role in shaping the American countryThen Dr. Kng’s speeches would have been considered a failure, because Dr. King <strong>envisioned</strong> a future where there are no prejudices, not only towards his own race but to all races. If this would result in violence then everything that he would have fought for would be for naught because enacting violence in the name of freedom would only further the cycle of hate that he wished to stop.I would like to ask him how he was able to do it to forego violence in exchange for a better way, a peaceful way of demonstration. I would ask him for advice and how he was able to be brave and stand up for what is right. I would ask for stories to inspire me and motivate me to become a better person in a world that is broken and hated. Given the chance and the background, yes I would dream the same dream. Knowing what the African - American community has been through and currently going thru, I think I would also dream of a better country for my people and all the other people residing in our country. I would dream of a society no longer gripped and overcome with hate and prejudice but a country of inclusion and equity. It would have been freeing both in mind, body, and spirit, knowing that something that his ancestors fought for and suffered for has finally come to fruition it would have been an unreal and freeing moment for him The is nothing more powerful than a united society with respect and care for each other. I think we would be able to achieve great things if we come to a point to set aside our differences and focus on creating a better country for the future generation and ourselves <p>To learn more about who Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/249478?referrer=searchResults</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><br />
