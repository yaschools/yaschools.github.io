"Just go to the gasoline station, and then have some drops, that's disinfectant."His spokesman had attempted to clarify previously that what the leader said was a joke, reminding the public that Duterte often says things in jest, after he made a similar remark last week, according to Reuters. Duterte claimed during a public broadcast on July 21 that that flammable liquids like petrol could be used to clean face masks if cleaning materials prove to be too expensive."At the end of the day, hang it somewhere and spray it with Lysol if you can afford it," Duterte said. Philippines health department and health experts refute Duterte's claims The country's Department of Health quickly issued a correction, suggesting that the president was joking and that residents should not take the advice seriously. "Cloth masks should be washed every day, after every use. It should be washed, and dried (under) the sun," the health undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said to reporters, according to Yahoo Philippines. Medical experts have also since refuted his claims, and said that his mask cleaning tips were not recommended. "You cannot use gasoline as disinfectant. Inhaling it may cause harm and could lead to more problems like respiratory disease," Jose Santiago, President of the Philippine Medical Association, told Reuters. It has been mandatory to wear masks in the Philippines since March 2020. The country has over 85,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and close to 2,000 deaths.Article 2 Philippines' Duterte recommends petrol to clean face masks, says 'not joking' By: World News Staff Published July 31, 2020 MANILA (Reuters) Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday told his people they should use gasoline as a disinfectant for protective face masks and stressed that his advice was not a joke. The outspoken leader last week made a similar remark about using petrol on masks if cleaning agents were unavailable, which his spokesman said was a joke and reminded the public that Duterte often says things in jest "What I said is true," Duterte said during a televised address on Friday. "Just go to the gasoline station, and then have some drops, that's disinfectant." He added: "I am not joking. That is true. You think I am just kidding." Mask-wearing has since March been mandatory in the Philippines, which hasconfirmed nearly 90,000 coronavirus infections and more than 2,000 deaths. It reported Southeast Asia's biggest daily jump in new coronavirus cases for a second straight day on Friday, as Duterte extended restrictions to quell the spread, and promised normality would return in December. Medical experts said his mask cleaning tips were not recommended. "You cannot use gasoline as disinfectant. Inhaling it may cause harm and could lead to more problems like respiratory disease," Jose Santiago, President of the Philippine Medical Association, told Reuters. Health experts recommend soap and water for cleaning reusable cloth masks, and 70% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol for proper disinfection. The first time Duterte suggested using petrol on masks, some opponents blasted him what they called dangerous advice.❗ PLEASE ANSWER PROPERLY ❗​​​​​​</a>

                                            QUESTION: What are the premises in the manifesto?
[Based on the context]
The University of the Philippine Center for Integrative and Development Studies Program on Alternative Development (UP CIDS AltDev), with civil society organizations, grassroots communities, and scholar-activists across Southeast Asia and the globe, condemns the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Bill of 2020. Nothing but a weapon to silence criticism and dissent toward the government, the proposed Bill is a threat to the fundamental constitutional rights of the Filipino people.
The Bill grants absolute power to the state and its repressive apparatuses such as the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to violate the Philippine Constitution and human rights. It harbors a vague definition of terrorism which permits the malicious tagging of activists, critics, and organizations as affiliates of so- called terrorist groups. Furthermore, the Bill undermines whatever “safeguard” it has by giving free rein to the Anti-Terror Council (ATC) to determine what constitutes “a serious
risk to public safety” and the act to “incite others” to commit terrorism. This paves the way for the warrantless arrest of members of civil society designated as “terrorist.” This may paralyze the broad grassroots movements and alternative practices engaged by communities and civil society organizations that counter the state’s aggressive, profit- oriented vision of development. No one is safe.
We believe that it is imperative that we put an end to terrorist activities. Our hearts and sympathies go out to all of those who have been victimized by acts of lawless violence. However, arming the government with punitive instruments and granting them a wide latitude of discretion, which the proposed bill provides, is not the answer. History will tell how current and past regimes have exhausted various means to amass political power through anti-people policies, as exemplified by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos who wore the same “anti-terrorism” veneer to quell critics and dissenters. Suffice to say, the “Terror Bill” does not and will not address the root causes of terrorism which is poverty and the corruption of power.
As scholars and activists, we cannot stand by as we lay witness to the passage of this bill, especially under the current regime which has not been shy to use violence against the weak, powerless and the poor. We believe that addressing terrorism must not be addressed through punitive and draconian measures. Quelling terroristic activities is built through a comprehensive approach towards attaining peace, social justice, equity with the genuine participation of its people. We do not need to further arm the coercive apparatuses of the state which has operated with impunity and has grotesquely performed its duties with abuses. In order to end terrorism, what our society needs are real opportunities for its people, schools for its children, protection for peoples across races, sexes, and genders, an end to discrimination and violence, and genuine, open and transformative conversations in our pursuit of development to be free from terrorism, the entire Philippine nation, and the rest of the world, must get rid of poverty, marginalization and vulnerabilities. We need and demand for socio-politico-economic transformation attuned to people’s aspirations and voices, not another gauntlet to further strangle the Filipino peoples.</a>

                                            Article 1 Philippines President Duterte says to use petrol to disinfect face masks &amp; he's not joking; Medical experts have since refuted his claims By: Julia Yeo Published August 01, 2020 President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte reiterated in a televised address on July 31 that petrol can be used for disinfecting face masks if cleaning agents were unavailable. Spokesman said Duterte was joking, Duterte says he's not "What I said is true," Duterte said. "Just go to the gasoline station, and then have some drops, that's disinfectant." His spokesman had attempted to clarify previously that what the leader said was a joke, reminding the public that Duterte often says things in jest, after he made a similar remark last week, according to Reuters. Duterte claimed during a public broadcast on July 21 that that flammable liquids like petrol could be used to clean face masks if cleaning materials prove to be too expensive. "At the end of the day, hang it somewhere and spray it with Lysol if you can afford it," Duterte said. Philippines health department and health experts refute Duterte's claims The country's Department of Health quickly issued a correction, suggesting that the president was joking and that residents should not take the advice seriously. "Cloth masks should be washed every day, after every use. It should be washed, and dried (under) the sun," the health undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said to reporters, according to Yahoo Philippines. Medical experts have also since refuted his claims, and said that his mask cleaning tips were not recommended. "You cannot use gasoline as disinfectant. Inhaling it may cause harm and could lead to more problems like respiratory disease," Jose Santiago, President of the Philippine Medical Association, told Reuters. It has been mandatory to wear masks in the Philippines since March 2020. The country has over 85,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and close to 2,000 deaths. Article 2 Philippines' Duterte recommends petrol to clean face masks, says 'not joking' By: World News Staff Published July 31, 2020 MANILA (Reuters) Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday told his people they should use gasoline as a disinfectant for protective face masks and stressed that his advice was not a joke. The outspoken leader last week made a similar remark about using petrol on masks if cleaning agents were unavailable, which his spokesman said was a joke and reminded the public that Duterte often says things in jest "What I said is true," Duterte said during a televised address on Friday. "Just go to the gasoline station, and then have some drops, that's disinfectant." He added: "I am not joking. That is true. You think I am just kidding." Mask-wearing has since March been mandatory in the Philippines, which has confirmed nearly 90,000 coronavirus infections and more than 2,000 deaths. It reported Southeast Asia's biggest daily jump in new coronavirus cases for a second straight day on Friday, as Duterte extended restrictions to quell the spread, and promised normality would return in December. Medical experts said his mask cleaning tips were not recommended. "You cannot use gasoline as disinfectant. Inhaling it may cause harm and could lead to more problems like respiratory disease," Jose Santiago, President of the Philippine Medical Association, told Reuters. Health experts recommend soap and water for cleaning reusable cloth masks, and 70% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol for proper disinfection. The first time Duterte suggested using petrol on masks, some opponents blasted him what they called dangerous advice. ❗ PLEASE ANSWER PROPERLY ❗​​</a>

De plus, il y a dix-sept aquariums là-bas. À Cherbourg, il y a aussi un musée d'art et un musée d'histoire. Comme j'adore l'histoire, je vais aller au musée de la Libération. Mais, Aurélie va aller au musée Thomas-Henry parce qu'elle s'intéresse à l'art. Demain, nous allons visiter le parc et le château des Ravalet. Ce château qui est très beau est construit en style Renaissance. Ça va être génial de le voir. Je vais t'envoyer des photos de Cherbourg. Gros bisous !

                            8. QUESTION: What are the premises in the manifesto?
[Based on the context]
The University of the Philippine Center for Integrative and Development Studies Program on Alternative Development (UP CIDS AltDev), with civil society organizations, grassroots communities, and scholar-activists across Southeast Asia and the globe, condemns the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Bill of 2020. Nothing but a weapon to silence criticism and dissent toward the government, the proposed Bill is a threat to the fundamental constitutional rights of the Filipino people.
The Bill grants absolute power to the state and its repressive apparatuses such as the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to violate the Philippine Constitution and human rights. It harbors a vague definition of terrorism which permits the malicious tagging of activists, critics, and organizations as affiliates of so- called terrorist groups. Furthermore, the Bill undermines whatever “safeguard” it has by giving free rein to the Anti-Terror Council (ATC) to determine what constitutes “a serious
risk to public safety” and the act to “incite others” to commit terrorism. This paves the way for the warrantless arrest of members of civil society designated as “terrorist.” This may paralyze the broad grassroots movements and alternative practices engaged by communities and civil society organizations that counter the state’s aggressive, profit- oriented vision of development. No one is safe.
We believe that it is imperative that we put an end to terrorist activities. Our hearts and sympathies go out to all of those who have been victimized by acts of lawless violence. However, arming the government with punitive instruments and granting them a wide latitude of discretion, which the proposed bill provides, is not the answer. History will tell how current and past regimes have exhausted various means to amass political power through anti-people policies, as exemplified by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos who wore the same “anti-terrorism” veneer to quell critics and dissenters. Suffice to say, the “Terror Bill” does not and will not address the root causes of terrorism which is poverty and the corruption of power.
As scholars and activists, we cannot stand by as we lay witness to the passage of this bill, especially under the current regime which has not been shy to use violence against the weak, powerless and the poor. We believe that addressing terrorism must not be addressed through punitive and draconian measures. Quelling terroristic activities is built through a comprehensive approach towards attaining peace, social justice, equity with the genuine participation of its people. We do not need to further arm the coercive apparatuses of the state which has operated with impunity and has grotesquely performed its duties with abuses. In order to end terrorism, what our society needs are real opportunities for its people, schools for its children, protection for peoples across races, sexes, and genders, an end to discrimination and violence, and genuine, open and transformative conversations in our pursuit of development to be free from terrorism, the entire Philippine nation, and the rest of the world, must get rid of poverty, marginalization and vulnerabilities. We need and demand for socio-politico-economic transformation attuned to people’s aspirations and voices, not another gauntlet to further strangle the Filipino peoples.</h2><br />

                            22. Article 1 Philippines President Duterte says to use petrol to disinfect face masks &amp; he's not joking; Medical experts have since refuted his claims By: Julia Yeo Published August 01, 2020 President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte reiterated in a televised address on July 31 that petrol can be used for disinfecting face masks if cleaning agents were unavailable. Spokesman said Duterte was joking, Duterte says he's not "What I said is true," Duterte said. "Just go to the gasoline station, and then have some drops, that's disinfectant." His spokesman had attempted to clarify previously that what the leader said was a joke, reminding the public that Duterte often says things in jest, after he made a similar remark last week, according to Reuters. Duterte claimed during a public broadcast on July 21 that that flammable liquids like petrol could be used to clean face masks if cleaning materials prove to be too expensive. "At the end of the day, hang it somewhere and spray it with Lysol if you can afford it," Duterte said. Philippines health department and health experts refute Duterte's claims The country's Department of Health quickly issued a correction, suggesting that the president was joking and that residents should not take the advice seriously. "Cloth masks should be washed every day, after every use. It should be washed, and dried (under) the sun," the health undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said to reporters, according to Yahoo Philippines. Medical experts have also since refuted his claims, and said that his mask cleaning tips were not recommended. "You cannot use gasoline as disinfectant. Inhaling it may cause harm and could lead to more problems like respiratory disease," Jose Santiago, President of the Philippine Medical Association, told Reuters. It has been mandatory to wear masks in the Philippines since March 2020. The country has over 85,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and close to 2,000 deaths. Article 2 Philippines' Duterte recommends petrol to clean face masks, says 'not joking' By: World News Staff Published July 31, 2020 MANILA (Reuters) Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday told his people they should use gasoline as a disinfectant for protective face masks and stressed that his advice was not a joke. The outspoken leader last week made a similar remark about using petrol on masks if cleaning agents were unavailable, which his spokesman said was a joke and reminded the public that Duterte often says things in jest "What I said is true," Duterte said during a televised address on Friday. "Just go to the gasoline station, and then have some drops, that's disinfectant." He added: "I am not joking. That is true. You think I am just kidding." Mask-wearing has since March been mandatory in the Philippines, which has confirmed nearly 90,000 coronavirus infections and more than 2,000 deaths. It reported Southeast Asia's biggest daily jump in new coronavirus cases for a second straight day on Friday, as Duterte extended restrictions to quell the spread, and promised normality would return in December. Medical experts said his mask cleaning tips were not recommended. "You cannot use gasoline as disinfectant. Inhaling it may cause harm and could lead to more problems like respiratory disease," Jose Santiago, President of the Philippine Medical Association, told Reuters. Health experts recommend soap and water for cleaning reusable cloth masks, and 70% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol for proper disinfection. The first time Duterte suggested using petrol on masks, some opponents blasted him what they called dangerous advice. ❗ PLEASE ANSWER PROPERLY ❗​​</h2><br />

Aurélie et moi sommes à Cherbourg, en Normandie. C'est un très beau port maritime. Aujourd'hui, nous allons faire beaucoup de tourisme. D'abord, nous allons visiter la Cité de la Mer. De plus, il y a dix-sept aquariums là-bas. À Cherbourg, il y a aussi un musée d'art et un musée d'histoire. Comme j'adore l'histoire, je vais aller au musée de la Libération. Mais, Aurélie va aller au musée Thomas-Henry parce qu'elle s'intéresse à l'art. Demain, nous allons visiter le parc et le château des Ravalet. Ce château qui est très beau est construit en style Renaissance. Ça va être génial de le voir. Je vais t'envoyer des photos de Cherbourg. Gros bisous !

                            29. Article 1 Philippines President Duterte says to use petrol to disinfect face masks &amp; he's not joking; Medical experts have since refuted his claims By: Julia Yeo Published August 01, 2020 President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte reiterated in a televised address on July 31 that petrol can be used for disinfecting face masks if cleaning agents were unavailable. Spokesman said Duterte was joking, Duterte says he's not "What I said is true," Duterte said. "Just go to the gasoline station, and then have some drops, that's disinfectant." His spokesman had attempted to clarify previously that what the leader said was a joke, reminding the public that Duterte often says things in jest, after he made a similar remark last week, according to Reuters. Duterte claimed during a public broadcast on July 21 that that flammable liquids like petrol could be used to clean face masks if cleaning materials prove to be too expensive. "At the end of the day, hang it somewhere and spray it with Lysol if you can afford it," Duterte said. Philippines health department and health experts refute Duterte's claims The country's Department of Health quickly issued a correction, suggesting that the president was joking and that residents should not take the advice seriously. "Cloth masks should be washed every day, after every use. It should be washed, and dried (under) the sun," the health undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said to reporters, according to Yahoo Philippines. Medical experts have also since refuted his claims, and said that his mask cleaning tips were not recommended. "You cannot use gasoline as disinfectant. Inhaling it may cause harm and could lead to more problems like respiratory disease," Jose Santiago, President of the Philippine Medical Association, told Reuters. It has been mandatory to wear masks in the Philippines since March 2020. The country has over 85,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and close to 2,000 deaths. Article 2 Philippines' Duterte recommends petrol to clean face masks, says 'not joking' By: World News Staff Published July 31, 2020 MANILA (Reuters) Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday told his people they should use gasoline as a disinfectant for protective face masks and stressed that his advice was not a joke. The outspoken leader last week made a similar remark about using petrol on masks if cleaning agents were unavailable, which his spokesman said was a joke and reminded the public that Duterte often says things in jest "What I said is true," Duterte said during a televised address on Friday. "Just go to the gasoline station, and then have some drops, that's disinfectant." He added: "I am not joking. That is true. You think I am just kidding." Mask-wearing has since March been mandatory in the Philippines, which has confirmed nearly 90,000 coronavirus infections and more than 2,000 deaths. It reported Southeast Asia's biggest daily jump in new coronavirus cases for a second straight day on Friday, as Duterte extended restrictions to quell the spread, and promised normality would return in December. Medical experts said his mask cleaning tips were not recommended. "You cannot use gasoline as disinfectant. Inhaling it may cause harm and could lead to more problems like respiratory disease," Jose Santiago, President of the Philippine Medical Association, told Reuters. Health experts recommend soap and water for cleaning reusable cloth masks, and 70% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol for proper disinfection. The first time Duterte suggested using petrol on masks, some opponents blasted him what they called dangerous advice. ❗ PLEASE ANSWER PROPERLY ❗​​</h2><br />
