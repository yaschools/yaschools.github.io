In one of her stints as a flight attendant, she used to give these instructions to the passengers: Ladies and gentlemen, in case of emergency, take the life jacket which is located under your seat. Put the life jacket over your head and then fasten the jacket tapes around your waist. Do not inflate the jacket until you left the aircraft. The jacket will automatically inflate by pulling a cord, but if not, you can blow into the chip to inflate it. A light is attached to the jacket for attracting attention. The life jacket should be removed only incase of emergency. The use of TV set, AM and FM radios and radio cassette recorders, walkman and any mobile phones are prohibited on board as they interfere the communication and navigational system. We wish you an enjoyable flight.

This program has adopted Sikolohiyang Pilipino as a program framework in reachingout to children who are victims of trauma.2. This provides subtle distinctiveness in several stages and manners of socialinteraction.3. This is considered as an important aspect of a people's life.4. By teaming up with the Department of Psychology, he initiated the reorientation of theteaching of psychology.5. To address the need of institutionalizing Sikolohiyang Pilipino, it was under Enriquez'sleadership that this organization was founded as a professional organization.6. In ancient times, there was no written history although the natives knew how to write;this is known as the ancient system of their writing.7. Pantayong Pananaw emerged from the UP Department of History under his initiative.8. These were often frowned upon by Western-oriented scholars, but Enriquez insistedthat if these concerns are being valued by Filipinos then they should be legitimatesubjects of psychological studies.9.

                                            Steel Belt Corporation- Staying alive When Richard Preston drove into work, a sick feeling of dread gnawed at his stomach. The morning paper had a front-page article on Steelbelt Corporation, the company where he had been working for the past 18 months. It was more bad news-a fiery crash that killed a young couple and their two children. The article said that a Steelbelt-500 tire on the crashed vehicle had failed. The journalist rehashed details from four other recent accidents involving Steelbelt tires. It raised questions about the quality of Steelbelt-500 tires, the same model that was manufactured at the plant where Richard worked. Now customers were afraid to buy Steelbelt's tires. Another article in the business section told of shareholders who were irate over a 50 percent drop in the value of the company's stock over the past two months. Rumors of layoffs and cost-cutting were circulating among Richard's co-workers. Two of Steelbelt's biggest customers were threatening to tear up their contracts to put the company's tires on 30 percent of their vehicles manufactured in North America and Europe. Steelbelt Corporation had been in business for more than 50 years and had grown from a single plant in Detroit to a multinational company. Richard had joined Steelbelt's internship program at the company's flagship plant right after completing his MBA. He had enjoyed his stints in production, purchasing, and finance. Sometimes, at lunch, he would hang out at the company's test track, watching the drivers and researchers from the lab. Richard loved working for Steelbelt-he loved the people, he loved the products, he loved the pioneering atmosphere. How could things have gone so terribly wrong? If you are Richard Preston, how can you handle this situation? What will you do for the corporation to survive this turmoil ?What are the external factors you can point out in the case which affects a firm's environment? ​</a>

                            18. Steel Belt Corporation- Staying alive When Richard Preston drove into work, a sick feeling of dread gnawed at his stomach. The morning paper had a front-page article on Steelbelt Corporation, the company where he had been working for the past 18 months. It was more bad news-a fiery crash that killed a young couple and their two children. The article said that a Steelbelt-500 tire on the crashed vehicle had failed. The journalist rehashed details from four other recent accidents involving Steelbelt tires. It raised questions about the quality of Steelbelt-500 tires, the same model that was manufactured at the plant where Richard worked. Now customers were afraid to buy Steelbelt's tires. Another article in the business section told of shareholders who were irate over a 50 percent drop in the value of the company's stock over the past two months. Rumors of layoffs and cost-cutting were circulating among Richard's co-workers. Two of Steelbelt's biggest customers were threatening to tear up their contracts to put the company's tires on 30 percent of their vehicles manufactured in North America and Europe. Steelbelt Corporation had been in business for more than 50 years and had grown from a single plant in Detroit to a multinational company. Richard had joined Steelbelt's internship program at the company's flagship plant right after completing his MBA. He had enjoyed his stints in production, purchasing, and finance. Sometimes, at lunch, he would hang out at the company's test track, watching the drivers and researchers from the lab. Richard loved working for Steelbelt-he loved the people, he loved the products, he loved the pioneering atmosphere. How could things have gone so terribly wrong? If you are Richard Preston, how can you handle this situation? What will you do for the corporation to survive this turmoil ?What are the external factors you can point out in the case which affects a firm's environment? ​</h2><br />
