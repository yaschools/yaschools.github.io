Read the selection and answer the questions that follow.Andres Bonifacio is a shining symbol of Filipino bravery and heroism. He may not have written novels or books, nor received higher education from universities, but he embodies the true meaning of heroism. The bravery that he displayed in the war truly manifests the strength and courage of Filipinos. He was only 14 years old when their parents died, and through his tenacity and perseverance, he was able to raise himself and his siblings. Leadership was a natural andoutstanding quality of Bonifacio. He was the first to take the first big, bold step towards freedom by leading uprisings that successfully reclaimed independencefrom the colonizers. However, he may be called, whether as the Father of the Katipunan or the Father of the Philippine Revolution or the Great Plebeian, Andres Bonifacio undoubtedly contributed much to the history and independence of the Philippines.

Fact or Bluff
 Nowadays, many Filipinos are confused about every statement that they hear or read in any news platforms. Agreements or disagreements are popping in in social media. Whether these statements are truth or opinion becomes a subject matter for everyone. Thus, the question is: “Is it a fact or a bluff?”
 I think no one values honesty. “BMD denies withholding funds”, “No Filipino is affected by pandemic in the US”, “Bitoy passes away”, “Palacio Filipino unaware of China’s firm”, “No Filipino believes worst of COVID-19 pandemic yet to come”…. These were just a few of headlines that we read on the newspaper and watch over the television, or even read on the online sites. In my opinion, these statements are more of a kind of a bluff than a fact. Moreover, if these are facts then we should have found proofs to verify these statements. Some are manipulating everything to hide the truth. Is it a fact or a bluff?
 I believe that Filipinos deserve to be informed of the truth. For instance, 57% based on the SWS survey of Filipinos believe worst of the pandemic yet to come. How can we enjoy the holiday seasons amidst this prediction? I think no Filipino family can have a merry Christmas this year. All of us will have “tawilis” on our table. Is it a fact or a bluff?

Early this year, news of anti-Asian hate crimes surfaced. And Filipinos are far from being safe. One of the victims is Filipino-American Vilma Kari, 65, who was knocked to the ground and kicked several times as she was on her way to church. Another victim is Filipino-American Noel Quintana, 61, who was slashed across the face with a box cutter on the subway. These are only two of the many anti-Asian hate crimes being reported in the US, not to mention the unreported cases. And every day, the number increases. The spike is believed to be caused by former US President Donald Trump's coronavirus remark as "China virus." 1. What is the text about? 2. How is bias reflected in the text? 3.

The wealthiest family in that area who happened to have large businesses have thought of a way to help SME's or the small business enterprises to recover, as well as those poor families affected by the said typhoon. The family then decided to allot funds to lend to those who are victims of calamity by giving a simple interest loan for only 10% per annum. If the family was able to lend P1,500,000.00, how much interest would be earned after 5 years? Use a model table discussed in this lesson to show the simple interest earned. What do you think about Filipino values being shown in this situation? Can you think of other means to help the community with an application of simple interest?

The Digital Divide
By: Kim Czaccei Dacanay
The digital divide exists in the Philippine education system for the
longest time, but the Pandemic exposed just how bad it is. The digital
divide is the barrier between those who have access to computers and the
internet and those who don’t.
Educational attainment is heavily affected by the digital divide, and
this remains true to many countries in the world. Many provinces in the
Philippines have a slim to none access to the internet connection. Students
and teachers would have to climb high places to get internet access. Also,
as reported by STAR last year, 13 million Filipino households don’t have
electricity.
Therefore, the transition to online classes will put certain Filipino
student population at a stark disadvantage. If there’s no internet
16
connection, how can the students do research work? How can they interact
with their instructors? How can they learn?
Education must not be exclusive for people who are privileged
enough to have a laptop and a stable internet connection.
Education is for everyone.

Save Rice, Save Lives The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reports that "one fifth of the world's population more than a billion people - depend on rice cultivation for their livelihoods". About 90% of this rice is grown in Asia by poor farmers from the rural areas. The Philippine Rice Research Institute (PRRI) says that "each Filipino wastes 2 tablespoons of cooked rice every day. When not wasted, this could result in import savings, as high as P6.2 billion and could feed 2.6 million hungry Filipinos in a year". For Filipinos, every meal is incomplete without rice. It is their main source of carbohydrates. If rice is wasted, more rice should be produced, which might affect its seling price. If more rice is needed by consumers and not enough rice is produced, the country could resort into importing rice from other counties. Besides, growing rice is not that easy and cheap. Farmers have to buy fertilizers, pay for seeding, spend for irrigation, and the use of equipment. Eat your rice right - the right amount, no leftovers. Be "rice-ponsible".

The Digital Divide By: Kim Czaccei Dacanay The digital divide exists in the Philippine education system for the longest time, but the Pandemic exposed just how bad it is. The digital divide is the barrier between those who have access to computers and the internet and those who don’t. Educational attainment is heavily affected by the digital divide, and this remains true to many countries in the world. Many provinces in the Philippines have a slim to none access to the internet connection. Students and teachers would have to climb high places to get internet access. Also, as reported by STAR last year, 13 million Filipino households don’t have electricity. Therefore, the transition to online classes will put certain Filipino student population at a stark disadvantage. If there’s no internetconnection, how can the students do research work? How can they interact with their instructors? How can they learn? Education must not be exclusive for people who are privileged enough to have a laptop and a stable internet connection. Education is for everyone. Write your judgement: ​</a>

The bravery that he displayed in the war truly manifests the strength and courage of Filipinos. He was only 14 years old when their parents died, and through his tenacity and perseverance, he was able to raise himself and his siblings. Leadership was a natural andoutstanding quality of Bonifacio. He was the first to take the first big, bold step towards freedom by leading uprisings that successfully reclaimed independencefrom the colonizers. However, he may be called, whether as the Father of the Katipunan or the Father of the Philippine Revolution or the Great Plebeian, Andres Bonifacio undoubtedly contributed much to the history and independence of the Philippines. He is truly a national hero. Heroes are special people who are called for a special mission. They motivate, help, and influence others.

                            11. Direction: Read the essay below. Choose the statements that show opinions. Write them on a separate answer sheet.
Fact or Bluff
 Nowadays, many Filipinos are confused about every statement that they hear or read in any news platforms. Agreements or disagreements are popping in in social media. Whether these statements are truth or opinion becomes a subject matter for everyone. Thus, the question is: “Is it a fact or a bluff?”
 I think no one values honesty. “BMD denies withholding funds”, “No Filipino is affected by pandemic in the US”, “Bitoy passes away”, “Palacio Filipino unaware of China’s firm”, “No Filipino believes worst of COVID-19 pandemic yet to come”…. These were just a few of headlines that we read on the newspaper and watch over the television, or even read on the online sites. In my opinion, these statements are more of a kind of a bluff than a fact. Moreover, if these are facts then we should have found proofs to verify these statements. Some are manipulating everything to hide the truth. Is it a fact or a bluff?
 I believe that Filipinos deserve to be informed of the truth. For instance, 57% based on the SWS survey of Filipinos believe worst of the pandemic yet to come. How can we enjoy the holiday seasons amidst this prediction? I think no Filipino family can have a merry Christmas this year. All of us will have “tawilis” on our table. Is it a fact or a bluff?
Activity 1: Share your Thoughts. Discuss your answer with an adult in your family and try to exchange ideas on this activity.
1.Were you able to identify opinionated statements and true statements?
2.What was your basis in identifying them?
Was it easy or difficult?</h2><br />

These are only two of the many anti-Asian hate crimes being reported in the US, not to mention the unreported cases. And every day, the number increases.

The Digital Divide
By: Kim Czaccei Dacanay
The digital divide exists in the Philippine education system for the
longest time, but the Pandemic exposed just how bad it is. The digital
divide is the barrier between those who have access to computers and the
internet and those who don’t.
Educational attainment is heavily affected by the digital divide, and
this remains true to many countries in the world. Many provinces in the
Philippines have a slim to none access to the internet connection. Students
and teachers would have to climb high places to get internet access. Also,
as reported by STAR last year, 13 million Filipino households don’t have
electricity.
Therefore, the transition to online classes will put certain Filipino
student population at a stark disadvantage. If there’s no internet
16
connection, how can the students do research work? How can they interact
with their instructors? How can they learn?
Education must not be exclusive for people who are privileged
enough to have a laptop and a stable internet connection.
Education is for everyone.

Save Rice, Save Lives The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reports that "one fifth of the world's population more than a billion people - depend on rice cultivation for their livelihoods". About 90% of this rice is grown in Asia by poor farmers from the rural areas. The Philippine Rice Research Institute (PRRI) says that "each Filipino wastes 2 tablespoons of cooked rice every day. When not wasted, this could result in import savings, as high as P6.2 billion and could feed 2.6 million hungry Filipinos in a year". For Filipinos, every meal is incomplete without rice. It is their main source of carbohydrates. If rice is wasted, more rice should be produced, which might affect its seling price. If more rice is needed by consumers and not enough rice is produced, the country could resort into importing rice from other counties. Besides, growing rice is not that easy and cheap. Farmers have to buy fertilizers, pay for seeding, spend for irrigation, and the use of equipment. Eat your rice right - the right amount, no leftovers. Be "rice-ponsible". "Save Rice, Save Lives," the campaign says. If you do, you save lives. Wouldn't it be more than nice What kind of text-type is the selection? What is the selection about? What does it say?

The Digital Divide By: Kim Czaccei Dacanay The digital divide exists in the Philippine education system for the longest time, but the Pandemic exposed just how bad it is. The digital divide is the barrier between those who have access to computers and the internet and those who don’t. Educational attainment is heavily affected by the digital divide, and this remains true to many countries in the world. Many provinces in the Philippines have a slim to none access to the internet connection. Students and teachers would have to climb high places to get internet access. Also, as reported by STAR last year, 13 million Filipino households don’t have electricity. Therefore, the transition to online classes will put certain Filipino student population at a stark disadvantage. If there’s no internetconnection, how can the students do research work? How can they interact with their instructors? How can they learn? Education must not be exclusive for people who are privileged enough to have a laptop and a stable internet connection. Education is for everyone. Write your judgement: ​</h2><br />
