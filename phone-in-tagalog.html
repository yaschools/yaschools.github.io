"Si Ma'am Kasi" ni Eros AtaliaFinal exam ng mga graduating. make or break. Terorista ang prof nila sa major subject na ito. Walang pakialam kung graduating ka o hindi. Kung bagsak, bagsak.Parang barangay tanod ang prof. Ikot nang ikot sa buong classroom. Lahat ng kahina-hinalang kilos, lingon o titig ng mga estudyante, sinisita nito.May nag-vibrate na cellphone na nakapatong sa armchair. “Turn it off! Or keep it way!”, bulyaw ng prof. Pinagtinginan ng lahat ang estudyanteng nagpupumilit na mai-off o itago ang cellphone. Balik uli ang lahat sa pagsasagot. Maya-maya, yung estudyanteng yun ay tumingin uli sa phone at pagkatapos ay sa prof. Nagduda na ang prof. Gawain kasi ng ibang estudyante na ilagay ang sagot sa cellphone. Lumalapit pa lang ang prof sa may hawak ng cellphone ay umiyak na ang estudyante. “Give me your phone, you’re cheating.” Pagkaabot ng estudyante ng cellphone sa teacher, dinampot na nito ang bag, at saka bumira ng takbo papalabas ng classroom, iniwan ang test paper. “Class, you’re all my witnesses, your classmate is cheating. Will you read kung anong nakalagay sa message?” Tumayo ang estudyanteng inutusan binasa ang phone.“Y di u sagot tawag namin? wala na si dad, ‘di niya nasurvive ang operation. d2 kami hospital.”PAKSA *2 puntosTONO *LAYON *PANANAW *PARAAN NG PAGKAKASULAT *PAGBUO NG SALITA *PAGBUO NG TALATA *PAGBUO NG PANGUNGUSAP NA GAMIT *"Tabloid: Isang Pagsusuri" ni William Rodriguez IIBuhay na buhay pa rin ang industriya ng diyaryo sa bansa dahil sa abot-kaya lang ang presyo. Ang katibayan nito ay ang dami ng mga tabloid na makikita sa mga bangketa. Bumebenta pa rin, kahit ang mga balita ay unang lumalabas sa telebisyon at naiulat na rin sa radyo. May sariling hatak ang nasa print media dahil lahat ay di naman naibabalita sa TV at radyo. Isa pa, hangga't naitatabi ang diyaryo ay may epekto pa rin sa mambabasa ang mga nilalaman nito. Iba't iba ang dahilan ng mga tao kung bakit nagbabasa ng diyaryo. Mayroong hanap talaga ay balita, magbasa ng tsismis, sports, literatura, o 'di kaya'y magsagot ng palaisipan. Pinagsama-sama na yata ang lahat sa diyaryo para magustuhan ng mga tao. Mainam itong pampalipas-oras kapag walang ginagawa. Sinasabing ang tabloid ay pangmasa dahil sa Tagalog ito nakasulat bagama't ilan dito ay ingles ang midyum. Hindi katulad sa broadsheet na ang target readers ay Class A at B. "Yun nga lang sa tabloid ay masyadong binibigyang-diin ang tungkol sa sex at karahasan kaya't tinagurian itong sensationalized journalism.PAKSA TONO LAYON PANANAW PARAAN NG PAGKAKASULAT PAGBUO NG SALITA PAGBUO NG TALATA PAGBUO NG PANGUNGUSAP</a>

Lumalapit pa lang ang prof sa may hawak ng cellphone ay umiyak na ang estudyante. “Give me your phone, you’re cheating.” Pagkaabot ng estudyante ng cellphone sa teacher, dinampot na nito ang bag, at saka bumira ng takbo papalabas ng classroom, iniwan ang test paper. “Class, you’re all my witnesses, your classmate is cheating. Will you read kung anong nakalagay sa message?” Tumayo ang estudyanteng inutusan binasa ang phone.“Y di u sagot tawag namin? wala na si dad, ‘di niya nasurvive ang operation. d2 kami hospital.”PAKSA *2 puntosTONO *LAYON *PANANAW *PARAAN NG PAGKAKASULAT *PAGBUO NG SALITA *PAGBUO NG TALATA *PAGBUO NG PANGUNGUSAP NA GAMIT *"Tabloid: Isang Pagsusuri" ni William Rodriguez IIBuhay na buhay pa rin ang industriya ng diyaryo sa bansa dahil sa abot-kaya lang ang presyo. Ang katibayan nito ay ang dami ng mga tabloid na makikita sa mga bangketa. Bumebenta pa rin, kahit ang mga balita ay unang lumalabas sa telebisyon at naiulat na rin sa radyo. May sariling hatak ang nasa print media dahil lahat ay di naman naibabalita sa TV at radyo. Isa pa, hangga't naitatabi ang diyaryo ay may epekto pa rin sa mambabasa ang mga nilalaman nito. Iba't iba ang dahilan ng mga tao kung bakit nagbabasa ng diyaryo. Mayroong hanap talaga ay balita, magbasa ng tsismis, sports, literatura, o 'di kaya'y magsagot ng palaisipan. Pinagsama-sama na yata ang lahat sa diyaryo para magustuhan ng mga tao. Mainam itong pampalipas-oras kapag walang ginagawa. Sinasabing ang tabloid ay pangmasa dahil sa Tagalog ito nakasulat bagama't ilan dito ay ingles ang midyum. Hindi katulad sa broadsheet na ang target readers ay Class A at B. "Yun nga lang sa tabloid ay masyadong binibigyang-diin ang tungkol sa sex at karahasan kaya't tinagurian itong sensationalized journalism.PAKSA TONO LAYON PANANAW PARAAN NG PAGKAKASULAT PAGBUO NG SALITA PAGBUO NG TALATA PAGBUO NG PANGUNGUSAP</h2><br />

                            24. 14. Ano ang tagalog ng Kelly had a job in a grocery store, but it didn't pay very much and she was sick of working there. Nonetheless, the work was steady and she needed all of the money that she could get. To her delight, Kelly got an interview at a big office in Tandag City for a job that paid much more. The interview went very well and the bosses all but offered her a position. They said that she would fit the role well and they promised that they would call her back within two weeks. Kelly couldn't wait to quit her job. As soon as she got back she quit her work in the store. She spent the next two weeks bragging to her coworkers about her new high-paying job in Tandag City. Yet, two weeks passed and she received no phone call. When Kelly decided to follow up on her interview, she learned that the bosses had chosen a different candidate. Kelly was crushed.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Si Kelly ay may trabaho sa isang grocery store, ngunit ito ay hindi gaanong binayaran at siya ay may sakit na magtrabaho doon. Gayunpaman, ang trabaho ay hindi nagbabago at kailangan niya ang lahat ng pera na makukuha niya. Sa kanyang tuwa, nagpa-interview si Kelly sa isang malaking opisina sa Tandag City para sa trabahong mas malaki ang sahod. Ang panayam ay naging napakahusay at ang mga amo ay nag-alok sa kanya ng isang posisyon. Babagay daw siya sa role at nangako silang tatawagan siya ulit within two weeks. Hindi na makapaghintay si Kelly na huminto sa kanyang trabaho. Pagbalik niya ay huminto siya sa kanyang trabaho sa tindahan. Ginugol niya ang sumunod na dalawang linggo sa pagyayabang sa kanyang mga katrabaho tungkol sa kanyang bagong trabahong may mataas na suweldo sa Tandag City. Gayunpaman, lumipas ang dalawang linggo at wala siyang natanggap na tawag sa telepono. Nang magpasya si Kelly na i-follow up ang kanyang panayam, nalaman niyang ibang kandidato ang pinili ng mga boss. Naiyak si Kelly.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Google translate </p><br />
