The system is characterized by the private ownership of resources and the use of markets  and prices to coordinate and direct economic activity.  Participants act in their own self-interest. Individuals and  businesses seek to achieve their economic goals through  their own decisions regarding work, consumption, or  production. The system allows for the private ownership  of capital, communicates through prices, and coordinates economic activity through markets—places where buyers and sellers come together.

                                            inequality in one variable. History of Carmona In the late 16th century, a Spanish colonial resettlement program was implemented across wide areas of what came to be known as the province of (EXAMPLE) CAVITE. The program was designed to integrate the Filipinos into the religious and political institutions of the Spaniards. (1)__________ was first established as a mission town in 1595. Together with the other mission towns in the province, it became one of the centers of religious and economic activities in the first centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Carmona used to be a barrio of the Mission Town of Silang. It was locally known as "(2)_____________ "", a tagalog word for plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. At that time, this barrio was just a small farming community with a very small population. As its population rapidly increased, religious and political separation from the town of Silang was later sought from Spain. Eventually, it became an independent municipality on February 20, 1857 by virtue of the Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de (5)__________ The name (3_______) was adopted as a sign of gratitude to the Spanish officials who influenced the Central Government at the time of separation of the barrio. With boundaries properly delineated and a church established, it started its own religious and political administration. The people of Carmona have actively participated in the revolution against the Spaniards. It also witnessed the Filipinos' resistance against the Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation, some of Carmona's prominent houses were used as Japanese headquarters while the hills became the stronghold of Filipino revolutionaries After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions or land conflicts.​</a>

                            8. The Market System The polar alternative to the command system is the mar ket system, or capitalism. The system is characterized by the private ownership of resources and the use of markets  and prices to coordinate and direct economic activity.  Participants act in their own self-interest. Individuals and  businesses seek to achieve their economic goals through  their own decisions regarding work, consumption, or  production. The system allows for the private ownership  of capital, communicates through prices, and coordinates economic activity through markets—places where buyers and sellers come together. Goods and services are produced and resources are supplied by whoever is willing and able to do so. The result is competition among independently  acting buyers and sellers of each product and resource. Thus, economic decision making is widely dispersed. Also,  the high potential monetary rewards create powerful in centives for existing firms to innovate and entrepreneurs  to pioneer new products and processes. In pure capitalism—or laissez-faire capitalism— government’s role would be limited to protecting private  tribution of output, and the organization of production. The government owns most of the business firms, which produce according to government directives. The central planning board determines production goals for each en terprise and specifies the amount of resources to be allo.  pakiexplain naman po sakin ng tagalog. buod po. salamat​</h2><br />
