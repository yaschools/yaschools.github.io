                                            LEARNING ACTIVITY SHEET 2.5 Boarding House Analogy Directions: Imagine you are the landlord of a very strange boarding house. Your job is to fill the rooms in the building in the most efficient way possible. The rules you have to follow are as strange as the building because quantum mechanics is not like anything you might have expected. State what electron rule is being applied in the situations stated on the left side of the table. Explain each rule. (This activity is adapted from birdvilleschoosi.net). Boarding House Rules Electron Rules From the Bottom Up: Rooms should be filled from the ground floor and up. Fill up first the rooms on the first floor before starting to put new tenants on the second floor. Singles First, the owner of the building wants to have the renters spread out as much as possible. For that reason, singles are placed first in rooms before couples. If couples must be placed into a room then all of the other rooms on that floor must already have a single in them, Opposite Gender Only: When two people are to be situated in a room, they must be of opposite genders. No men may stay together, and no women may room together. This is an arbitrary rule on the part of the owners: in a just world, we wouldn't have to follow it, but quantum mechanics has nothing to do with society's norm.​</a>

My first choice was to get an apartment. Unfortunately, I quicklyfound out that the only area I could afford was an hour's subway ride from downtown. I then decidedto look for a studio in a neighborhood closer to work. I spoke with a number of landlords, but wasn'table to find anything. Then, I decided to go to a real estate agent for help. The agent was very helpful,but the fee was a full month's rent! I agreed and the agent showed me a few places. The first was!in the basement and had very bad lighting. The next place was a furnished studio that was verycluttered. The last place was on quiet block with parking in the back. I signed the lease immediately.1.

                            4. LEARNING ACTIVITY SHEET 2.5 Boarding House Analogy Directions: Imagine you are the landlord of a very strange boarding house. Your job is to fill the rooms in the building in the most efficient way possible. The rules you have to follow are as strange as the building because quantum mechanics is not like anything you might have expected. State what electron rule is being applied in the situations stated on the left side of the table. Explain each rule. (This activity is adapted from birdvilleschoosi.net). Boarding House Rules Electron Rules From the Bottom Up: Rooms should be filled from the ground floor and up. Fill up first the rooms on the first floor before starting to put new tenants on the second floor. Singles First, the owner of the building wants to have the renters spread out as much as possible. For that reason, singles are placed first in rooms before couples. If couples must be placed into a room then all of the other rooms on that floor must already have a single in them, Opposite Gender Only: When two people are to be situated in a room, they must be of opposite genders. No men may stay together, and no women may room together. This is an arbitrary rule on the part of the owners: in a just world, we wouldn't have to follow it, but quantum mechanics has nothing to do with society's norm.​</h2><br />

                            6. Your apartment was burglarized, and many things were stolen, including a television in your living room. That television, however, had been broken down, irreparably, and was worthless you just haven’t had the time or money to replace it. Luckily you have renter’s insurance to cover your losses. Do you include the television in your insurance claim? Why?</h2><br />
                        <p>No, it would not be ethical to include the broken television in the insurance claim because it was already considered worthless before the burglary. Including it in the claim would be an act of fraud and can result in legal and financial consequences. It's important to be honest and only claim for items that were actually lost or damaged during the burglary.</p><br />

Unfortunately, I quicklyfound out that the only area I could afford was an hour's subway ride from downtown. I then decidedto look for a studio in a neighborhood closer to work. I spoke with a number of landlords, but wasn'table to find anything. Then, I decided to go to a real estate agent for help. The agent was very helpful,but the fee was a full month's rent! I agreed and the agent showed me a few places. The first was!in the basement and had very bad lighting. The next place was a furnished studio that was verycluttered. The last place was on quiet block with parking in the back. I signed the lease immediately.1.
