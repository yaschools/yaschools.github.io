So, what are we waiting for? Let's go and invite him now to join us! lunch, Andrew eagerly asked. All together, the three of them approached Jose and greeted him, would you like to join us for lunch? Jose was so surprised that he was not able to reply at once. After a couple of seconds, he smiled and said, Oh, hi! Are you really inviting me for lunch? Jose timidly asked? " Yes, we are inviting you for lunch, "the three boys replied in unison. " Oh, yes, I would like to join!" Jose immediately replied. From then on Jose became happy as he was frequently invited by the three boys to join the group. They became friends, and they all played and ate together.1. Who was the transferee in grade four?2.

                                            CONFLICT THEORY
This sociological perspective is the opposite of the latter. Karl Marx viewed social stratification as creation of inequality between the rich and the poor, or the powerful versus the powerless. Let's say for example: The bourgeois capitalists owning high-producing businesses or factories and hire people who work for them. They can enjoy the luxury of life because they earn billions of money. However, proletariats are the working class earned skimpy wages and experiencing isolation to the society. The very essence of life is to enjoy it with loved ones. However, 'working class did not experience this joy because they are isolated to do the labor for long hours each day to earn money at the end of the month. Marx argued that proletariats were oppressed by the money-hungry bourgeois.

Let us make a Concept Map about the measures of central tendency and use the numbers shown from the cards to identify the mean, median, mode, range, and interquartile range. Solution: The picture above illustrates the tabletop game using cards. This game is called Solitaire (Solitaryo in tagalog ay larong nagsasanay ng utak) and can be played by one person. This is popular among people even in the old times, particularly in a remote area. In San Pablo City, we can observe our grandparents playing these tabletop game cards solely while resting after a hard time working from the farm. Solitaire is an excellent way to diffuse any tension in one's mind or body and helps the person enjoys the day or get to sleep better at night; enough sleep keeps the body healthy. It gives the mind something to focus on, particularly in times of low action when the opportunity to fret is high, Let us use the number in each card in reviewing the concepts about the measures of central tendency and variability These numbers are :7.10,8, 4, 6,3,7 By Concept Mapping you can easily organize your knowledge learned from the previous lessons you had when you were in grade 8 CONCEPT MAP द/ average highest frequency MEAN MODE Measures of Central Tendency​</a>

It was built in 1591.In my experience this belfry will like take you to you to the past and experience the breath taking view There is also one place here in our beloved Bantay that is also good for instagram because of its natural beauty and this is the Bicential Park of Bantay.This place was visited by some teenagers because its very relaxing and good for dating and bonding with family.I also go here and i can say that the view,the nature and the peacefulness was really incredible.This park was really good for those who want to relax and foget their problem for a meantime.This park was open for 5 am to 9 pm.And if youre hungry or thirsty theres some store that sells snacks and drinks. Bantay was one of the sources of rice because we are surrounded by farmland and my grandfather was also a farmer and im very proud of that,without them theres no rice we are eating right now.Twenty years from now you will be more dissapointed by the things you didn't do by the ones you did do.

He may not understand us in invite him to join our group." Paolo immediately replied. He may not enjoy the same thing that we enjoy as Manileños, Miguel, another classmate of Andrew, added. Wel, you are both right," Andrew said. But I think we should not ignore him just becaus he is different from us. I do not think it is right to judge him before we even try to ma friends with him. So, what are we waiting for? Let's go and invite him now to join us! lunch, Andrew eagerly asked. All together, the three of them approached Jose and greeted him, would you like to join us for lunch? Jose was so surprised that he was not able to reply at once. After a couple of seconds, he smiled and said, Oh, hi! Are you really inviting me for lunch? Jose timidly asked? " Yes, we are inviting you for lunch, "the three boys replied in unison. " Oh, yes, I would like to join!" Jose immediately replied. From then on Jose became happy as he was frequently invited by the three boys to join the group. They became friends, and they all played and ate together.1. Who was the transferee in grade four?2.

                            8. CONFLICT THEORY
This sociological perspective is the opposite of the latter. Karl Marx viewed social stratification as creation of inequality between the rich and the poor, or the powerful versus the powerless. Let's say for example: The bourgeois capitalists owning high-producing businesses or factories and hire people who work for them. They can enjoy the luxury of life because they earn billions of money. However, proletariats are the working class earned skimpy wages and experiencing isolation to the society. The very essence of life is to enjoy it with loved ones. However, 'working class did not experience this joy because they are isolated to do the labor for long hours each day to earn money at the end of the month. Marx argued that proletariats were oppressed by the money-hungry bourgeois.

Solution: The picture above illustrates the tabletop game using cards. This game is called Solitaire (Solitaryo in tagalog ay larong nagsasanay ng utak) and can be played by one person. This is popular among people even in the old times, particularly in a remote area. In San Pablo City, we can observe our grandparents playing these tabletop game cards solely while resting after a hard time working from the farm. Solitaire is an excellent way to diffuse any tension in one's mind or body and helps the person enjoys the day or get to sleep better at night; enough sleep keeps the body healthy. It gives the mind something to focus on, particularly in times of low action when the opportunity to fret is high, Let us use the number in each card in reviewing the concepts about the measures of central tendency and variability These numbers are :7.10,8, 4, 6,3,7 By Concept Mapping you can easily organize your knowledge learned from the previous lessons you had when you were in grade 8 CONCEPT MAP द/ average highest frequency MEAN MODE Measures of Central Tendency​</h2><br />

Travel offers you to offer a chance to enjoy life .You can meet fascinating people and experience  interesting cultures.I know some of us are doing some activities to prevent boredom  especially we  are facing the Corona Virus.Also I know that you really want to travel now but because of pandemic you cant,so im going to tour you in our municipality.Bantay Bell tower is one we are proud of not only because of its historical and cultural significance but also because of its commanding view of Vigan from the highest portion of it that can be climbed . It was said to be the people’s watchtower, part of the city’s defense that helps in alerting it against possible enemies. It was built in 1591.In my experience this belfry will like take you to you to the past and experience the breath taking view There is also one place here in our beloved Bantay that is also good for instagram because of its natural beauty and this is the Bicential Park of Bantay.This place was visited by some teenagers because its very relaxing and good for dating and bonding with family.I also go here and i can say that the view,the nature and the peacefulness was really incredible.This park was really good for those who want to relax and foget their problem for a meantime.This park was open for 5 am to 9 pm.And if youre hungry or thirsty theres some store that sells snacks and drinks. Bantay was one of the sources of rice because we are surrounded by farmland and my grandfather was also a farmer and im very proud of that,without them theres no rice we are eating right now.Twenty years from now you will be more dissapointed by the things you didn't do by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines .Catch the trade winds in your sails.Explore,Dream,Discover and be with our relaxing municality.
