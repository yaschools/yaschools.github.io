Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</a>

                                            Wook 5-Friendly Creatures Read and Learn Read the story. Fish is Fish Adapted At the edge of the woods, there was a pond, and there a minnow and a tadpole swam among the weeds. They were inseparable friends. They were always together. One morning, the tadpole discovered that during the night he had grown two little legs. "Look, "he said triumphantly. "Look, I am a frog!" "Nonsense," said the minnow. "How could you be a frog if only last night you were a little fish, just like mer They argued and argued until finally the tadpole said, "Frogs are frogs and fish is fish and that's that!" In the weeks that followed, the tadpole grew tiny front legs and his tail got smaller and smaller. And one day, a real frog now, he climbed out of the water and onto the grassy bank. He often wondered where his four-footed friend had gone. But The minnow had grown and had become a full-fledged fish. days and weeks went by but the frog did not return. Where do you think had the frog gone? Then, one day, with a happy splash that shook the weeds, the frog jumped into the pond. "Where have you been?" asked the fish excitedly. "I have been about the world-hopping here and there," have seen extraordinary things." DATE T. Who are the characters in the story! 2. 7. What did the fish and the prog argue about? NO 3 What happened to the pish one day! 4. What is good ending for the story. "Like what?" asked the fish. "Birds," said the frog mysteriously. "Birds?" And he told the fish about the birds that had wings, and two legs, and many, many colors. As the frog talked, his friend saw the birds fly through his mind like a large feathered fish. "What else?" asked the fish impatiently. "Cows," said the frog. "Cows?" They have four legs, horns, eat grass, and carry pink bags of milk." "And people! Men, women, children! And he talked and talked until it was dark in the pond. But the picture in the fish's mind was full of lights and colors and marvelous things and he couldn't sleep. Ah, if he could only jump about like his friend and see that wonderful world. And so the days went by. The frog had gone and the fish just lay there dreaming about birds in flight, grazing cows, and those strange animals all dressed up that his friend called people. One day, he finally decided that come what may, he too must see them. And so with a mighty whack of the tail he jumped clear out of the water onto the bank. What do you think will happen to the fish? Why? He landed in the dry, warm grass and there he lay gasping for air, unable to breathe or move. "Help," he groaned feebly. What do you think will happen? Guess the ending of the story. 11.

                                            My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it-a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university. knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary. with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.  1. What is the author's present situation? A. He is a biologist. B. He is an intern.

                                            What is Globalization?We often hear the word globalization in many contexts and repeated frequently as a concept to denote more trade, foreign companies, and even the ongoing economic crisis. Before we launch into a full-fledged review of the term and its various manifestations, we should consider what we mean when we say globalization.Globalization is the free movement of goods, services, and people across the world in a seamless and integrated manner. Globalization can be the result of the opening up of the global economy and the concomitant increase in trade between nations. In other words, when countries that were hitherto closed to trade and foreign investment open up their economies and go global, the result is increasing interconnectedness and integration of the world economies.Globalization can also mean that countries liberalize their import protocols and welcome foreign investment into sectors that are the mainstays of its economy. Globalization means that countries attract global capital by opening up their economies to multinational corporations. Globalization also means that countries liberalize their visa rules and procedures to permit the free flow of people from country to country. Globalization frees up the unproductive sectors to investment and the productive sectors to export-related activities resulting in a win-win situation for world economies.Source: https://www.managementstudyguide.com/what-is-globalization.htmAnswer the following questions:1.       According to the article, what is globalization?2.       After reading the article, do you think globalization is important? Why or why not?​</a>

                                            A JUNE 12 THOUGHT: RESPECT FLAG RITES A flag ceremony, wherever it be a flag raising or a flag retreat is sacred. Therefore, it should be observed with all the solemnity and sacredness a Filipino citizen can muster. The National Anthem (Pambansang Awit), like the national flag, should be treated with ceremonial respect. On this anniversary of the declaration of Independent in Kawit in 1898 it is perhaps timely to remind all and to behave during flag ceremonies. Sad to say, many students during the Monday morning flag raising ceremonies, instead of standing at attention while singing the National Anthem, and while reciting the Patriotic Fledge (Panatang Makabayan), move around play and have completely disregarding what’s going on. It is for this reasons that we are calling the attention of all teachers, especially the social studies teachers to give more emphasis on teaching values, love of country, respect for the flag, veneration of heroes, and proper behavior during flag ceremonies. In flag ceremonies cannot be held properly, why then do we hold them all.a.Editorisl of Special occasion     b. Editorial of Criticism     c. Editorial of Commendation       d.

The preceding teacher had trained the children to be in their places at her arrival, and when Anne entered the schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of "shining morning faces" and bright, inquisitive eyes. She hung up her hat and faced her pupils, hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and that they would not perceive how she was trembling. She had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a speech, she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school. She had revised and improved it painstakingly, and then she had learned it off by heart. It was a very good speech and had some very fine ideas in it, especially about mutual help and earnest striving after knowledge. The only trouble was that she could not now remember a word of it. After what seemed to her a year ... about ten seconds in reality... she said faintly, "Take your Testaments, please," and sank breathlessly into her chair under cover of the rustle and clatter of desk lids that followed.

Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</h2><br />

"How could you be a frog if only last night you were a little fish, just like mer They argued and argued until finally the tadpole said, "Frogs are frogs and fish is fish and that's that!" In the weeks that followed, the tadpole grew tiny front legs and his tail got smaller and smaller. And one day, a real frog now, he climbed out of the water and onto the grassy bank. He often wondered where his four-footed friend had gone. But The minnow had grown and had become a full-fledged fish. days and weeks went by but the frog did not return. Where do you think had the frog gone? Then, one day, with a happy splash that shook the weeds, the frog jumped into the pond. "Where have you been?" asked the fish excitedly.

And he told the fish about the birds that had wings, and two legs, and many, many colors. As the frog talked, his friend saw the birds fly through his mind like a large feathered fish. "What else?" asked the fish impatiently. "Cows," said the frog. "Cows?" They have four legs, horns, eat grass, and carry pink bags of milk." "And people! Men, women, children! And he talked and talked until it was dark in the pond. But the picture in the fish's mind was full of lights and colors and marvelous things and he couldn't sleep. Ah, if he could only jump about like his friend and see that wonderful world. And so the days went by. The frog had gone and the fish just lay there dreaming about birds in flight, grazing cows, and those strange animals all dressed up that his friend called people. One day, he finally decided that come what may, he too must see them. And so with a mighty whack of the tail he jumped clear out of the water onto the bank. What do you think will happen to the fish?

                            14. My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it-a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university. knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary. with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.  1. What is the author's present situation? A. He is a biologist. B. He is an intern.

                            15. What is Globalization?We often hear the word globalization in many contexts and repeated frequently as a concept to denote more trade, foreign companies, and even the ongoing economic crisis. Before we launch into a full-fledged review of the term and its various manifestations, we should consider what we mean when we say globalization.Globalization is the free movement of goods, services, and people across the world in a seamless and integrated manner. Globalization can be the result of the opening up of the global economy and the concomitant increase in trade between nations. In other words, when countries that were hitherto closed to trade and foreign investment open up their economies and go global, the result is increasing interconnectedness and integration of the world economies.Globalization can also mean that countries liberalize their import protocols and welcome foreign investment into sectors that are the mainstays of its economy. Globalization means that countries attract global capital by opening up their economies to multinational corporations. Globalization also means that countries liberalize their visa rules and procedures to permit the free flow of people from country to country. Globalization frees up the unproductive sectors to investment and the productive sectors to export-related activities resulting in a win-win situation for world economies.Source: https://www.managementstudyguide.com/what-is-globalization.htmAnswer the following questions:1.

                            19. A JUNE 12 THOUGHT: RESPECT FLAG RITES A flag ceremony, wherever it be a flag raising or a flag retreat is sacred. Therefore, it should be observed with all the solemnity and sacredness a Filipino citizen can muster. The National Anthem (Pambansang Awit), like the national flag, should be treated with ceremonial respect. On this anniversary of the declaration of Independent in Kawit in 1898 it is perhaps timely to remind all and to behave during flag ceremonies. Sad to say, many students during the Monday morning flag raising ceremonies, instead of standing at attention while singing the National Anthem, and while reciting the Patriotic Fledge (Panatang Makabayan), move around play and have completely disregarding what’s going on. It is for this reasons that we are calling the attention of all teachers, especially the social studies teachers to give more emphasis on teaching values, love of country, respect for the flag, veneration of heroes, and proper behavior during flag ceremonies. In flag ceremonies cannot be held properly, why then do we hold them all.a.Editorisl of Special occasion     b. Editorial of Criticism     c. Editorial of Commendation       d.

The preceding teacher had trained the children to be in their places at her arrival, and when Anne entered the schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of "shining morning faces" and bright, inquisitive eyes. She hung up her hat and faced her pupils, hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and that they would not perceive how she was trembling. She had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a speech, she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school. She had revised and improved it painstakingly, and then she had learned it off by heart. It was a very good speech and had some very fine ideas in it, especially about mutual help and earnest striving after knowledge. The only trouble was that she could not now remember a word of it.
