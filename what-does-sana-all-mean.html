                                            INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTStudent:Mr. Javier, you know that everyone is greatly concerned about pollution. I lived in Mindanao last year. But I think the pollution is worse in the cities. To what extent is air polluted in Metro Manila, sir?Mr. Javier:Indeed, the quality of air in Metro Manila is very poor. Our studies here in DENR show that the air around Metro Manila contains up to three times the volumes of pollutants in what should be normal or “healthy” air for us to breathe.Student:May I know what these pollutants are?Mr. Javier:There are six major ones: carbon monoxide, nitrogen, dioxide, sulfur dioxide, lead, particulates, and total oxidants.Student:Oh, I must take down all of them. How do these pollutants get into the air, sir?Mr. Javier:Here in Metro Manila, motor vehicles are the dominant sources of pollution. Our study shows that diesel-fueled vehicles are the primary sources of particulate matter. Gasoline powered vehicles, on the other hand, are the main sources of land pollutants. Student:It’s my first time to hear about particulate matter. What is it, sir?Mr. Javier:Particulate matter is made up of all sorts of tiny particles in the air, like dust and the ashfall from Mt. Pinatubo. What we see coming out of “smoke-belching” jeepneys and buses are, in fact, millions of tiny pieces of burnt oil and fuel.Student:Why should we be concerned about air pollutants?Mr. Javier:You see particulate matter has been found to be the most damaging to our health. It can cause cancer and pulmonary diseases. Lead, too, poses a health hazard, especially to children. Studies have shown that the children with high levels of lead experience more behavioral problems and decrease ability to concentrate. So, don’t be out in the streets so often. Student:I learned so much from you sir. Thank you for sharing your expertise with me.Mr. Javier:You’re welcome. See you again.1. what is the interview all about?2. according to mr. Javier what is a particulate matter?3. what could be the effect of particulate matter to our health?4. based on how the world is used in the interview transcript, what does "pullutants" means?5. do you think the interview gets all the information she wants? why did you say?guys patulong nmn need lng ng kapatid ko thank you sa magsasagot.* Yung maayos po Sana thank you ulit sa magsasagot..​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer no 1. -</strong>The line is crooked(like the saw teeth with sharp edges or amplitude of a speaker) for both the graphs. Both graphs also show a periodic pattern.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer no 2.</strong> - In Graph A,atomic radius is greater at certain atomic numbers. It shows that as x increases, y sometimes decreases. With reference to the periodic table, the pattern is indeed periodic showing that atomic radius decreases from right to left and bottom to top. In Graph B, at certain atomic numbers, first ionization energy appears to be higher. With reference to the periodic table, ionization energy increases from left to right and from bottom to top.</p><br />

This is where the use of figurative language comes in. When writers use figurative language (or a figure of speech), they are able to express a clearer picture with their words, creating more of an impact with their creative writing.</p><p>4.He says his cries are “bootless”, which basically means that he thinks they are worthless, because nobody hears them.

                            12. INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTStudent:Mr. Javier, you know that everyone is greatly concerned about pollution. I lived in Mindanao last year. But I think the pollution is worse in the cities. To what extent is air polluted in Metro Manila, sir?Mr. Javier:Indeed, the quality of air in Metro Manila is very poor. Our studies here in DENR show that the air around Metro Manila contains up to three times the volumes of pollutants in what should be normal or “healthy” air for us to breathe.Student:May I know what these pollutants are?Mr. Javier:There are six major ones: carbon monoxide, nitrogen, dioxide, sulfur dioxide, lead, particulates, and total oxidants.Student:Oh, I must take down all of them. How do these pollutants get into the air, sir?Mr. Javier:Here in Metro Manila, motor vehicles are the dominant sources of pollution. Our study shows that diesel-fueled vehicles are the primary sources of particulate matter. Gasoline powered vehicles, on the other hand, are the main sources of land pollutants. Student:It’s my first time to hear about particulate matter. What is it, sir?Mr. Javier:Particulate matter is made up of all sorts of tiny particles in the air, like dust and the ashfall from Mt. Pinatubo. What we see coming out of “smoke-belching” jeepneys and buses are, in fact, millions of tiny pieces of burnt oil and fuel.Student:Why should we be concerned about air pollutants?Mr. Javier:You see particulate matter has been found to be the most damaging to our health. It can cause cancer and pulmonary diseases. Lead, too, poses a health hazard, especially to children. Studies have shown that the children with high levels of lead experience more behavioral problems and decrease ability to concentrate. So, don’t be out in the streets so often. Student:I learned so much from you sir. Thank you for sharing your expertise with me.Mr. Javier:You’re welcome. See you again.1. what is the interview all about?2. according to mr.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The term carbon cycle refers to the movement of carbon atoms through living 
</p><p>organisms, the oceans, the atmosphere and the Earth’s interior and crust. </p><p>
</p><p>2. All animals relate to the carbon cycle because all organisms are based on the 
</p><p>carbon atom. Also, when animals eat food, they ingest carbon in the form of 
</p><p>carbohydrates and proteins. This carbon combines with oxygen to give energy for 
</p><p>daily activity. </p><p>
</p><p>3. A carbon atom that existed as carbon dioxide (CO2) during the Carboniferous 
</p><p>Period could have ended up at the bottom of a murky swamp if this carbon atom
</p><p>had first been absorbed by a green, leafy plant that used the carbon atom to 
</p><p>produce a sugar molecule through photosynthesis. This sugar molecule became a 
</p><p>structural part of the one of the plant cells. Eventually, the leafy plant died and 
</p><p>sank to the bottom of a murky swamp and became covered by other decayedferns. </p><p>
</p><p>4. Coal was eventually formed from this carbon atom when the climate changed and 
</p><p>became drier and less tropical. Materials such as sand and dust covered the 
</p><p>ancient swamp and sealed the decaying plant material under a thick layer of 
</p><p>sediment, which hardened and turned into rock. The carbon atom remained in this 
</p><p>rock and was turned into coal from the high pressure of other sedimentary layers. 
</p><p>Today, coal is burned in power plants to create electricity to fuel industrial 
</p><p>civilization. </p><p>
</p><p>5. The same carbon atom could have ended up in a dinosaur’s stomach if the carbon 
</p><p>atom had been absorbed by the leafy fern and then ingested by a hungry dinosaur 
</p><p>in the form of carbohydrates and proteins. </p><p>
</p><p>6. This carbon atom became re-released into the atmosphere after the dinosaur had 
</p><p>eaten the fern, ingesting the carbon atom, and using it to make energy. The carbon 
</p><p>atoms was a waste product of this process and left the dinosaur’s body when he 
</p><p>exhaled. </p><p>
</p><p>7. The carbon atom met a tiny marine organism when the carbon atom (as carbon 
</p><p>dioxide, CO2) was floating over a warm ocean surface and was absorbed by the 
</p><p>water. Once the CO2 molecule was dissolved in the ocean water, it was captured 
</p><p>by a tiny marine organism. The carbon atom then helped the little sea creature 
</p><p>build its shell. </p><p>
</p><p>8. The carbon atom became natural chalk after it was captured by the tiny marine 
</p><p>creature, who used the carbon to build its shell. When the sea creature died, its 
</p><p>remnants (including its shell) sank to the bottom of the ocean floor and formed 
</p><p>sediments of limestone and chalk. These sediments were raised above sea level by 
</p><p>tectonic activity to create large rock formations, like the White Cliffs of Dover, 
</p><p>where a lot of natural chalk is mined today. </p><p>
</p><p>9. We can release the carbon contained in the natural chalk, which could be from the 
</p><p>exhaled breath of a dinosaur, through a simple chemical reaction with vinegar. 
</p><p>The carbon atoms combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form carbon 
</p><p>dioxide.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sorry if it was long, sorry</p><br />
