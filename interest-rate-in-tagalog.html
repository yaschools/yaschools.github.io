                                            Taong 1940 nakipag alyansa si Nazy Germany sa isang grupo na parte ng mga kontroladong bansa. Itinulak ni Nazy ang kanyang mga kasosyo na gumawa ng labis para ang sobra ay i-import sa German. Resulta nito ay napanatili ng Britain ang financial ng Bansang Sterling. Habang si Germany naman ay nagtagumpay sa pagpilit sa mga kasosyo nito sa kalakalan na bilhin ang mga kalakal nito. Ang Estados Unidos ay nababahala na baka bumalik ang level ng kawalan ng trabaho ng dahil sa pagbaba ng pag gastos sa digmaan. Kaya ginusto ng U.S. na mag-import sa kanilang bansa ang mga bansang Sterling at European. Bilang Resulta nito ay sinuportahan ng Estados Unido ang malayang kalakalan at kakayang baguhin ang mga pera sa ginto o dolyar.Sa comference ng Bretton Woods, maraming mga specialist ang nakapanood sa 1930's became architects of new, united postwar system, na ang mga ideyang gumagabay ay naging "no more beggar thy neighbor o sa tagalog wala ng pulubi sa iyong lugar at "manage flows of speculative financial capital". Iniiwasan ng madaming bansa na maulit pa ang prosesong ito na pwedeng magpababa sa halaga, na hindi magpipilit sa mga bansang may utang na bawasan ang kanilang baseng pang-industriya, sa pagpapanatili sa mataas na interest rates ay mas maaatrak ang mga internasyonal na banko. Si John Maynard Keynes ang nangungunang ekonomista na ang pangunahing ideya nito ay nagpabago sa pag unawa sa macroeconomics at iba pang uso sa patakarang pang ekonomiya, na nagpanatili sa bansa na bumalik sa Great Depression. Si keynes ang nasa likod ng panukala ng Britain na pilitin ang mga surplus na bansa sa pamamagitan ng mekanismong "use-it-or-lose-it" para mag import, magtayo ng mga pabrika at mag donate sa mga bansang may utang.

                            3. Taong 1940 nakipag alyansa si Nazy Germany sa isang grupo na parte ng mga kontroladong bansa. Itinulak ni Nazy ang kanyang mga kasosyo na gumawa ng labis para ang sobra ay i-import sa German. Resulta nito ay napanatili ng Britain ang financial ng Bansang Sterling. Habang si Germany naman ay nagtagumpay sa pagpilit sa mga kasosyo nito sa kalakalan na bilhin ang mga kalakal nito. Ang Estados Unidos ay nababahala na baka bumalik ang level ng kawalan ng trabaho ng dahil sa pagbaba ng pag gastos sa digmaan. Kaya ginusto ng U.S. na mag-import sa kanilang bansa ang mga bansang Sterling at European. Bilang Resulta nito ay sinuportahan ng Estados Unido ang malayang kalakalan at kakayang baguhin ang mga pera sa ginto o dolyar.Sa comference ng Bretton Woods, maraming mga specialist ang nakapanood sa 1930's became architects of new, united postwar system, na ang mga ideyang gumagabay ay naging "no more beggar thy neighbor o sa tagalog wala ng pulubi sa iyong lugar at "manage flows of speculative financial capital". Iniiwasan ng madaming bansa na maulit pa ang prosesong ito na pwedeng magpababa sa halaga, na hindi magpipilit sa mga bansang may utang na bawasan ang kanilang baseng pang-industriya, sa pagpapanatili sa mataas na interest rates ay mas maaatrak ang mga internasyonal na banko. Si John Maynard Keynes ang nangungunang ekonomista na ang pangunahing ideya nito ay nagpabago sa pag unawa sa macroeconomics at iba pang uso sa patakarang pang ekonomiya, na nagpanatili sa bansa na bumalik sa Great Depression. Si keynes ang nasa likod ng panukala ng Britain na pilitin ang mga surplus na bansa sa pamamagitan ng mekanismong "use-it-or-lose-it" para mag import, magtayo ng mga pabrika at mag donate sa mga bansang may utang.
