                                            1. “Mother tongue education refers to any form of schooling that makes use of the language or languages that children are most familiar with. This is usually the language that children speak at home with their family. The ‘mother tongue’ does not have to be the language spoken by the mother. Children can and often do speak more than one or even two languages at home.”
2. “Another way to grasp the concept of animatism is to differentiate the Cebuano terms gahum and kusog. Gahum comes closer to the Tagalog galing, acquired power or skill as in the case of politics, while kusog comes closer to the Tagalog lakas, an almost innate power with connotations of dynamism and energy.”

Uwang and Salagubang "Uwang" (Rhinoceros Beetle in English) is one of the few beetles called by name in the Philippines. Other beetles are referred to as "salagubang", the generic Tagalog word for beetle. Although we can see various pictures of Rhinoceros Beetle online, nothing can compare to seeing one up close and personal. From experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it's really impossible to get it off easily. The variety found in the Philippines is the Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle. They may seem formidable and vicious, but appearance can be deceiving. They have sharp claws and those claws can only hurt you if you get pinched by them. Other than that, they are practically harmless. They also have horns and there is a difference in length depending on whether it's a male or female. From what I understand, it's the strongest insect in the world. I'm not willing to test the assertion. 1. What are the names of the two types of beetles which are found in the Philippines? 2. What variety of beetles do those two types come from? 3. How did the author describe the claws of "uwang" and "salagubang"? 4. Do you think you will be hurt once you see an "uwang" or "salagubang" 5. What do you think is the purpose of the selection?​</a>

This is usually the language that children speak at home with their family. The ‘mother tongue’ does not have to be the language spoken by the mother. Children can and often do speak more than one or even two languages at home.”
2. “Another way to grasp the concept of animatism is to differentiate the Cebuano terms gahum and kusog. Gahum comes closer to the Tagalog galing, acquired power or skill as in the case of politics, while kusog comes closer to the Tagalog lakas, an almost innate power with connotations of dynamism and energy.”

Other beetles are referred to as "salagubang", the generic Tagalog word for beetle. Although we can see various pictures of Rhinoceros Beetle online, nothing can compare to seeing one up close and personal. From experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it's really impossible to get it off easily. The variety found in the Philippines is the Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle. They may seem formidable and vicious, but appearance can be deceiving. They have sharp claws and those claws can only hurt you if you get pinched by them. Other than that, they are practically harmless. They also have horns and there is a difference in length depending on whether it's a male or female. From what I understand, it's the strongest insect in the world. I'm not willing to test the assertion. 1. What are the names of the two types of beetles which are found in the Philippines? 2. What variety of beetles do those two types come from? 3. How did the author describe the claws of "uwang" and "salagubang"? 4. Do you think you will be hurt once you see an "uwang" or "salagubang" 5.

F</strong></p><p><strong>6. A</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> 1. <strong>Exosphere</strong>. The <strong>exosphere</strong> is the most distant atmospheric region from Earth's surface.</p><p>2. The<strong> ionosphere </strong>stretches roughly 50 to 400 miles above Earth's surface, right at the edge of space. Along with the neutral upper atmosphere, the ionosphere forms the boundary between Earth's lower atmosphere — where we live and breathe — and the vacuum of space.</p><p>3. The <strong>mesosphere</strong> is the least-understood part of Earth's atmosphere. It is too high for aircraft or weather balloons to operate, but too low for spacecraft</p><p>4. <strong>Stratosphere</strong>. The next layer up is called the stratosphere. The stratosphere extends from the top of the troposphere to about 50 km (31 miles) above the ground. The infamous ozone layer is found within the stratosphere.</p><p>5. Above: The space shuttle orbits in the <strong>thermosphere</strong>, a tenuous layer of our atmosphere that gets hotter and expands during solar maximum. The puffed-up<strong> thermosphere </strong>increases drag on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites</p><p>6. <strong>Troposphere.</strong> The troposphere is the lowest layer of our atmosphere. Starting at ground level, it extends upward to about 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above sea level. We humans live in the troposphere, and nearly all weather occurs in this lowest layer. </p><p>No Worries, i did research on my answers i can assure you they are 100% correct. and i have tripled checked it, now i only wish for a thanks and a 5 star and brainliest, <strong>Thank you &amp; Welcome</strong></p><br />
