                    <p>E Learning Task 4: Read this selection and note the details by answering the questions below. Write your answers in your notebook. Uwang and Salagubang &quot;Uwang&quot; (Rhinoceros Beetle in English) is one of the few beetles called by name in the Philippines. Other beetles are referred to as &quot;salagubang&quot;, the generic Tagalog word for beetle. Although we can see various pictures of Rhinoceros Beetle online, nothing can compare to seeing one up close and personal. From experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it&#039;s really impossible to get it off easily. The variety found in the Philippines is the Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle. They may seem formidable and vicious, but appearance can be deceiving. They have sharp claws and those claws can only hurt you if you get pinched by them. Other than that, they are practically harmless. They also have horns and there is a difference in length depending on whether it&#039;s a male or female. From what I understand, it&#039;s the strongest insect in the world. I&#039;m not willing to test the assertion. 1. What are the names of the two types of beetles which are found in the Philippines? 2. What variety of beetles do those two types come from? 3. How did the author describe the claws of &quot;uwang&quot; and &quot;salagubang&quot;? 4. Do you think you will be hurt once you see an &quot;uwang&quot; or &quot;salagubang&quot; 5. What do you think is the purpose of the selection?​</p>

                                            Uwang and Salagubang “Uwang” (Rhinoceros Beetle in English) is one of the few beetles called by name in the Philippines. Other beetles are referred to as “salagubang", the generic Tagalog word for beetle. Although we can see various pictures of Rhinoceros Beetle online, nothing can compare to seeing one up close and personal. From experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it's really impossible to get it off easily. The variety found in the Philippines is the Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle. They may seem formidable and vicious, but appearance can be deceiving. They have sharp claws and those claws can only hurt you if you get pinched by them. Other than that, they are practically harmless. They also have horns and there is a difference in length depending on whether it's a male or female. From what I understand, it's the strongest insect in the world. I'm not willing to test the assertion. 1. What are the names of the two types of beetles which are found in the Philippines? 2. What variety of beetles do those two types come from? 3. How did the author describe the claws of "uwang" and "salagubang" ? 4. Do you think you will be hurt once you see an "uwang" or “salagubang" 5. What do you think is the purpose of the selection? Learning Task 5: What do you usually imagine?

                                            ano ang tagalog ng "Hrothgar is the King of the Danes in southern Denmark. Through success in battle he has become rich and mighty. As a symbol of his power and prosperity he builds a magnificent mead-hall, called Heorot, in which he and his loyal warriors can feast, drink, boast, and listen to the tales of the scops, the Anglo-Saxon bards. But soon after Heorot is finished, the mirth of the men and the music of the scop anger Grendel, a monster descended from Cain. Grendel raids the hall, snatching men and eating them, then returns to his home in the marsh. He repeats his nightly raids until no one dares sleep in the hall. Heorot, once the symbol of the Scyldings’ greatness, is now a place of shame and terror. This continues for twelve years, until Beowulf, a young warrior of the Geats in southern Sweden, hears about Grendel and, determined to fight the monster, sails to Hrothgar’s lands with fifteen companions.
 Hrothgar, who knew Beowulf’s father Ecgtheow, accepts Beowulf’s offer to fight Grendel and gives him a feast, though Beowulf and Unferth, a warrior loyal to Hrothgar, exchange insults. That night, the warriors sleep in Heorot, with Beowulf keeping watch. Grendel arrives and consumes one of the warriors, then reaches for Beowulf. Beowulf, famous for his powerful grip, which is as strong as the grip of thirty men, struggles with Grendel, tearing off the monster’s shoulder and arm. Grendel returns to the fens to die. His arm is hung as a trophy under the roof of Heorot.
 Hrothgar gives a second feast to celebrate Beowulf’s victory. At the feast, Hrothgar generously rewards Beowulf with treasure. The scop sings again, and Beowulf is praised until nightfall. That night, Grendel’s mother comes to the hall from her home in the bottom of a lake, seeking revenge for the death of her son. She grabs Aeschere, a favorite warrior and adviser of Hrothgar’s, and consumes him, then returns home. In the morning, the warriors follow her tracks to her lake, where they see Aeschere’s head. Beowulf enters the lake, and swims for hours before reaching her cave at the bottom. He fights with Grendel’s mother, but the sword Hrunting, which Unferth lent to Beowulf in a sign of fellowship, fails for the first time. From the treasure hoard in the cave Beowulf seizes a sword forged long ago by giants and kills Grendel’s mother. He sees Grendel’s body, and removes the head, and takes it and the hilt of the giant’s sword (the blade melted on contact with the monster’s blood) back to Hrothgar. 
There is another celebration in Heorot with more gifts and promises of friendship. Hrothgar says he feels like Beowulf is his son, and weeps at Beowulf’s departure. Beowulf and his men return to the land of the Geats, where his uncle the king, Hygelac, and Hygelac’s queen Hygd, greet Beowulf, accepting the treasure Beowulf gives them, and in turn rewarding Beowulf with a sword, praise, and land. Hygelac is eventually killed by the Swedes; his son Heardred, though young, takes the throne with Beowulf’s support. At Heardred’s death, Beowulf takes the throne of the Geats, and rules in great prosperity and fame for fifty years. 
 In Beowulf’s old age, a thief finds a passageway into an old barrow. Inside, a dragon guards a treasure trove left there long ago by the last survivor of an extinct people. The thief steals a cup, but the dragon discovers the theft and burns the land, including Beowulf’s mead-hall. Beowulf, knowing his death is near, decides to fight the dragon. Accompanied by his kinsman Wiglaf, ten warriors, and the thief, Beowulf sets out to confront the dragon. But when Beowulf and the dragon fight, all of Beowulf’s men flee except Wiglaf. With Wiglaf’s help Beowulf kills the dragon, but not before he himself is terribly wounded.
 Before he dies, Beowulf tells Wiglaf to rule after him, and to build him a funeral barrow that overlooks the sea. Wiglaf chastises the men for abandoning their lord. A messenger sent to tell the Geats of Beowulf’s death also warns of hard times for the Geats, now that Beowulf is dead. The Geats build a pyre and cremate Beowulf, then construct a barrow overlooking the sea, burying the dragon’s cursed treasure with him."</a>

                                            translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The uwang (in English, the Rhinoceros Beetle) is one of the few beetles called by name in the Philippines. Other beetles are referred to as salagubang, the generic Tagalog word for beetle.
</p><p>
</p><p>Although you can find various pictures online of the Rhinoceros Beetle, nothing can compare to seeing one up close and personal. From experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it's nearly impossible to get it off without killing it. The variety found in the Philippines is the Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle.
</p><p>
</p><p>They may seem formidable and vicious, but appearances can be deceiving. They have sharp claws, and those claws can only hurt you if you get pinched by them. Other than that, they're practically harmless. They also have horns, and there is a difference in length depending on whether it's male or female.
</p><p>
</p><p>From what I understand, it's the strongest insect in the world. I'm not willing to test that assertion.
</p><p>
</p><p>Beetles of All Kinds
</p><p>There are beetles in the Philippines that I've never seen anywhere else in the world, and I'd be lying if I told you I could name any of them. There are also beetles in the Philippines who could be considered "undocumented immigrants" from the United States, hitching rides on cargo ships and airplanes. Of course, I'm sure they come from other places as well, like Korea, Japan and China.
</p><p>
</p><p>Interestingly, a bilas of mine (a sister-in-law's husband) has a sister who was given the nickname of "Ubang" when she was young, which is short for salagubang. It took me a while to figure out it was because she was afraid of beetles when she was young, not because she looks like one (she doesn't, of course).
</p><p>
</p><p>Beetle Pest Control
</p><p>There really isn't any way to control these little creatures without causing environmental damage. They won't normally go where people go unless they're seeking a new food source (certain plants and trees). They usually only get into houses when people leave their doors open. The uwang is too big to fit under the bottom of most doors when the doors are properly closed.
</p><p>
</p><p>It's important to have bug screens on window frames and trust me, you can find houses in the Philippines with window frames only, without anything in the frames. During the cool months, windows aren't that important, but bug screens are always important, and not just to keep beetles out. I'm also talking about mosquitoes, dragonflies and praying mantises, all of which have entered my house when doors or windows were open.
</p><p>
</p><p>Years ago, one of my young nieces (a teenager today) was jumping around hysterically, crying and whining at the same time. It took a minute or more to realize which of the beetles had attached it to the backside of the t-shirt she was wearing. Removing her t-shirt from her body was far easier than removing the uwang from her t-shirt. It didn't want to let go.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            9. ano ang tagalog ng "Hrothgar is the King of the Danes in southern Denmark. Through success in battle he has become rich and mighty. As a symbol of his power and prosperity he builds a magnificent mead-hall, called Heorot, in which he and his loyal warriors can feast, drink, boast, and listen to the tales of the scops, the Anglo-Saxon bards. But soon after Heorot is finished, the mirth of the men and the music of the scop anger Grendel, a monster descended from Cain. Grendel raids the hall, snatching men and eating them, then returns to his home in the marsh. He repeats his nightly raids until no one dares sleep in the hall. Heorot, once the symbol of the Scyldings’ greatness, is now a place of shame and terror. This continues for twelve years, until Beowulf, a young warrior of the Geats in southern Sweden, hears about Grendel and, determined to fight the monster, sails to Hrothgar’s lands with fifteen companions.
 Hrothgar, who knew Beowulf’s father Ecgtheow, accepts Beowulf’s offer to fight Grendel and gives him a feast, though Beowulf and Unferth, a warrior loyal to Hrothgar, exchange insults. That night, the warriors sleep in Heorot, with Beowulf keeping watch. Grendel arrives and consumes one of the warriors, then reaches for Beowulf. Beowulf, famous for his powerful grip, which is as strong as the grip of thirty men, struggles with Grendel, tearing off the monster’s shoulder and arm. Grendel returns to the fens to die. His arm is hung as a trophy under the roof of Heorot.
 Hrothgar gives a second feast to celebrate Beowulf’s victory. At the feast, Hrothgar generously rewards Beowulf with treasure. The scop sings again, and Beowulf is praised until nightfall. That night, Grendel’s mother comes to the hall from her home in the bottom of a lake, seeking revenge for the death of her son. She grabs Aeschere, a favorite warrior and adviser of Hrothgar’s, and consumes him, then returns home. In the morning, the warriors follow her tracks to her lake, where they see Aeschere’s head. Beowulf enters the lake, and swims for hours before reaching her cave at the bottom. He fights with Grendel’s mother, but the sword Hrunting, which Unferth lent to Beowulf in a sign of fellowship, fails for the first time. From the treasure hoard in the cave Beowulf seizes a sword forged long ago by giants and kills Grendel’s mother. He sees Grendel’s body, and removes the head, and takes it and the hilt of the giant’s sword (the blade melted on contact with the monster’s blood) back to Hrothgar. 
There is another celebration in Heorot with more gifts and promises of friendship. Hrothgar says he feels like Beowulf is his son, and weeps at Beowulf’s departure. Beowulf and his men return to the land of the Geats, where his uncle the king, Hygelac, and Hygelac’s queen Hygd, greet Beowulf, accepting the treasure Beowulf gives them, and in turn rewarding Beowulf with a sword, praise, and land. Hygelac is eventually killed by the Swedes; his son Heardred, though young, takes the throne with Beowulf’s support. At Heardred’s death, Beowulf takes the throne of the Geats, and rules in great prosperity and fame for fifty years. 
 In Beowulf’s old age, a thief finds a passageway into an old barrow. Inside, a dragon guards a treasure trove left there long ago by the last survivor of an extinct people. The thief steals a cup, but the dragon discovers the theft and burns the land, including Beowulf’s mead-hall. Beowulf, knowing his death is near, decides to fight the dragon. Accompanied by his kinsman Wiglaf, ten warriors, and the thief, Beowulf sets out to confront the dragon. But when Beowulf and the dragon fight, all of Beowulf’s men flee except Wiglaf. With Wiglaf’s help Beowulf kills the dragon, but not before he himself is terribly wounded.
 Before he dies, Beowulf tells Wiglaf to rule after him, and to build him a funeral barrow that overlooks the sea. Wiglaf chastises the men for abandoning their lord. A messenger sent to tell the Geats of Beowulf’s death also warns of hard times for the Geats, now that Beowulf is dead. The Geats build a pyre and cremate Beowulf, then construct a barrow overlooking the sea, burying the dragon’s cursed treasure with him."</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:"Si Hrothgar ang Hari ng mga Danes sa timog ng Denmark. Sa pamamagitan ng tagumpay sa labanan, siya ay naging mayaman at makapangyarihan. Bilang simbolo ng kanyang kapangyarihan at kasaganaan, siya ay nagtatayo ng isang kahanga-hangang mead-hall, na tinatawag na Heorot, kung saan siya at ang kanyang mga tapat na mandirigma Pansin, uminom, ipagmalaki, at pakinggan ang mga tale ng scops, Anglo-Saxon bards. Ngunit sa lalong madaling panahon matapos ang Heorot ay natapos, ang kagalakan ng mga tao at ang musika ng scop ng galit Grendel, isang halimaw ay nagmula mula kay Cain. ang bulwagan, kinuha ang mga lalaki at kumain sa kanila, at pagkatapos ay bumalik sa kanyang bahay sa bana. Inuulit niya ang kanyang mga gabiing pagsalakay hanggang sa walang sinuman ang makatutulog sa bulwagan. Si Heorot, minsan ang simbolo ng kalaking Scyldings, ay isang lugar ng kahihiyan at ito ay nagpapatuloy sa loob ng labindalawang taon, hanggang sa si Beowulf, isang batang mandirigma ng Geats sa timog Sweden, ay nakakarinig tungkol kay Grendel at, determinadong labanan ang halimaw, maglayag sa mga lupain ng Hrothgar na may labinlimang kasama.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Si Hrothgar, na nakakaalam ng ama ni Beowulf na Ecgtheow, ay tumatanggap ng alok ni Beowulf upang labanan si Grendel at binigyan siya ng isang kapistahan, bagama't si Beowulf at Unferth, isang matapat na mandirigma kay Hrothgar, nagbago ng mga insulto. Nang gabing iyon, ang mga mandirigma ay nakatulog sa Heorot, kasama ang Beowulf na nagbabantay. Si Grendel ay dumating at kumakain ng isa sa mga mandirigma, at pagkatapos ay umaabot sa Beowulf. Beowulf, sikat dahil sa kanyang malakas na mahigpit na pagkakahawak, na kasing lakas ng mahigpit na pagkakahawak ng tatlumpung lalaki, nakikipagpunyagi kay Grendel, lumubog sa balikat at braso ng halimaw. Nagbalik si Grendel sa fens upang mamatay. Ang kanyang bisig ay nakabitin bilang tropeo sa ilalim ng bubong ng Heorot.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Si Hrothgar ay nagbibigay ng pangalawang kapistahan upang ipagdiwang ang tagumpay ni Beowulf. Sa kapistahan, binigyan ni Hrothgar ng gantimpala ang Beowulf ng kayamanan. Ang scoping sings muli, at Beowulf ay praised hanggang sa takipsilim. Nang gabing iyon, ang ina ni Grendel ay dumating sa bulwagan mula sa kanyang bahay sa ilalim ng isang lawa, naghahangad ng paghihiganti para sa pagkamatay ng kanyang anak. Kinuha niya ang Aeschere, isang paboritong mandirigma at tagapayo ni Hrothgar, at kumakain sa kanya, pagkatapos ay bumalik sa bahay. Sa umaga, sinundan ng mga mandirigma ang kanyang mga track sa kanyang lawa, kung saan nakikita nila ang ulo ni Aeschere. Ang Beowulf ay pumasok sa lawa, at lumalangoy nang ilang oras bago maabot ang kanyang yungib sa ibaba. Siya ay nakikipaglaban sa ina ni Grendel, ngunit ang tabak na Hrunting, na Unferth lent sa Beowulf sa isang tanda ng pagsasama, ay nabigo sa unang pagkakataon. Mula sa hoard ng kayamanan sa yungib Beowulf ay sinamsam ang isang tabak na pinanghawakan ng mga higante at pinatay ang ina ni Grendel. Nakikita niya ang katawan ni Grendel, at inaalis ang ulo, at kinuha ito at ang sibat ng higanteng tabak (ang talim na natunaw sa pakikipag-ugnay sa dugo ng halimaw) pabalik sa Hrothgar.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            11. translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</h2><br />
