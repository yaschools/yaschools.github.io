Vicki Baum's evocative historical novel recounts the lives of peasants and nobles in colonial Bali, reared against a backdrop of bloodshed and cultural invasion. Dutch imperialism brings upheaval and revolution to the beautiful island, and the Balinese rebel in what would become a powerful and poignant example of symbolic resistance. A Tale from Bali culminates with the historic Battle of Badung, in which thousands of Balinese soldiers, clothed in white and armed only with daggers, threw themselves upon the merciless efficiency of the Dutch guns.

                                            Our Mother Tongue (Written by: Jose P. Rizal) If truly a people dearly love The tongue to them by Heaven sent, They'll surely yearn for liberty Like a bird above in the firmament. Because by its language one can judge A town, a barrio, and kingdom; And like any other created thing Every human being loves his freedom. One who doesn't love his native tongue, Is worse than putrid fish and beast; And like a truly precious thing It therefore deserves to be cherished. The Tagalog language's akin to Latin, To English, Spanish, angelical tongue; For God who knows how to look after us This language He bestowed us upon. As others, our language is the same With alphabet and letters of its own, It was lost because a storm did destroy On the lake the bangka 1 in years bygone. QUESTIONS: 3.

One of America’s gifts to us is efficiency, the scientific coordination of planning and action, the philosophy of correct and timely execution. Though long schooled in our Oriental disrespect for Time and encouraged, though unwittingly, to expect the Will that causes the palay to grow to also do our work for us, we realize at last that Time is an element to reckon with, that life here and now, being spread thinly over a limited period of years, must be economized and put to some profitable use. 
Our special significance is this realization in the economic life of our people. The bureaucratic system has impressed upon most of us that we must observe punctuality or lose out; that out pay envelop comes to many of us during stated periods of the month and not before or after, although we may spend its content in advance; and that our efficiency of times detrmine our income.</a>

Vicki Baum's evocative historical novel recounts the lives of peasants and nobles in colonial Bali, reared against a backdrop of bloodshed and cultural invasion. Dutch imperialism brings upheaval and revolution to the beautiful island, and the Balinese rebel in what would become a powerful and poignant example of symbolic resistance. A Tale from Bali culminates with the historic Battle of Badung, in which thousands of Balinese soldiers, clothed in white and armed only with daggers, threw themselves upon the merciless efficiency of the Dutch guns.

                            8. Our Mother Tongue (Written by: Jose P. Rizal) If truly a people dearly love The tongue to them by Heaven sent, They'll surely yearn for liberty Like a bird above in the firmament. Because by its language one can judge A town, a barrio, and kingdom; And like any other created thing Every human being loves his freedom. One who doesn't love his native tongue, Is worse than putrid fish and beast; And like a truly precious thing It therefore deserves to be cherished. The Tagalog language's akin to Latin, To English, Spanish, angelical tongue; For God who knows how to look after us This language He bestowed us upon. As others, our language is the same With alphabet and letters of its own, It was lost because a storm did destroy On the lake the bangka 1 in years bygone. QUESTIONS: 3. What Literary Influence does the poem have? Explain why. need help huhu╥﹏╥╥﹏╥​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Jose Rizal's poem "<strong>Our Mother Tongue</strong>" makes use of various literary influences, including <strong>Romanticism and Nationalism</strong>. <strong>Romanticism</strong> is evident in the poem's emotional tone and imagery, as well as in its emphasis on individual experience and feeling. <strong>Nationalism</strong> is also a major influence in the poem, as Rizal seeks to promote a sense of national identity and pride among the Filipino people. Rizal also draws on the traditions of oral poetry and folklore in his use of repetition, rhythm, and metaphor, highlighting the potential of the Filipino language as a powerful tool for artistic expression and cultural resistance. His use of Romantic and Nationalist themes, along with his incorporation of traditional Filipino literary techniques, make the poem a powerful and evocative expression of Filipino identity and pride.</p><br />

                            17. The muscle tissue of healthy fish is assumed sterile upon catch, whereas bacteria are typically found on all outer surfaces (skin, shell, and gills) as well as in the alimentary tract. Still, newly harvested fish from cold waters are usually considered to represent a low risk with respect to consumer hazards (Feldhusen, 2000, Painter et al., 2013), where scombrotoxin (i.e. histamine) intoxication is most frequently reported (Huss et al., 2000). (in Tagalog)Ang tissue ng kalamnan ng malusog na isda ay ipinapalagay na sterile kapag nahuli, samantalang ang bacteria ay karaniwang matatagpuan sa lahat ng panlabas na ibabaw (balat, shell, at hasang) gayundin sa alimentary tract. Gayunpaman, ang mga bagong ani na isda mula sa malamig na tubig ay karaniwang itinuturing na kumakatawan sa isang mababang panganib na may kinalaman sa mga panganib ng consumer (Feldhusen, 2000, Painter et al., 2013), kung saan ang scombrotoxin (ie histamine) na pagkalasing ay pinakamadalas na naiulat (Huss et al. , 2000).(kindly explain briefly) thank you in advance. ​</h2><br />

One of America’s gifts to us is efficiency, the scientific coordination of planning and action, the philosophy of correct and timely execution. Though long schooled in our Oriental disrespect for Time and encouraged, though unwittingly, to expect the Will that causes the palay to grow to also do our work for us, we realize at last that Time is an element to reckon with, that life here and now, being spread thinly over a limited period of years, must be economized and put to some profitable use. 
Our special significance is this realization in the economic life of our people. The bureaucratic system has impressed upon most of us that we must observe punctuality or lose out; that out pay envelop comes to many of us during stated periods of the month and not before or after, although we may spend its content in advance; and that our efficiency of times detrmine our income.</h2><br />
