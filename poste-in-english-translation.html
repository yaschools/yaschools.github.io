                                            WORKSHEET #.1 IN ENGLISH 9Prejudice refers to a preconceived opinion or feeling toward a person based solely on their affiliation with a group. This feelingmay be translated into action by discriminating against the person or members of the target group. An individual may beprejudiced against others based on factors such as race, age, gender, sexual crientation, class status, religion, nationality, andamongst other thingsExaniples:a) "I don't want Blacks living in my neighborhood!"b) "I don't want Jews owning businesses in my town!"c) "I don't want a Muslim community center in lower Manhattan!"These examples clearly show that there are prejudices going on. The statements prejudge against black people, Jews, andMuslims basically because of their race, nationality and religion Even though they have not done anything wrong yet, but becauseof their backgrounds, people tend to prejudge them and eventually discriminate them. These are very common in our society evenup to the present time.Another term that causes confusion and is often used interchangeably with "prejudice" is "bias". But these two termsdiffer from each other. Let's examine how it differs from the formerBias is a tendency to lean in a certain direction, either in favor of or against a particular thing. To be truly biased meansto lack a neutral viewpoint on a particular topic. Somewhere along the line, bias took on a negative connotation. If you're biasedtoward something, then you lean favorably toward it; you tend to think positively of it. Meanwhile, if you're biased againstsomething, then you lean negatively against it; you tend to think poorly of it.Examples:a) In other Christian sects, the preacher position is only given to niales and not to females.b) Sectarian schools only accept students who share the same religious beliefs.c) Sonie churches don't accept women who wear pants instead of dresses or skirts during their services.In the given examples, a certain group or people is given favor than the other.

                            9. WORKSHEET #.1 IN ENGLISH 9Prejudice refers to a preconceived opinion or feeling toward a person based solely on their affiliation with a group. This feelingmay be translated into action by discriminating against the person or members of the target group. An individual may beprejudiced against others based on factors such as race, age, gender, sexual crientation, class status, religion, nationality, andamongst other thingsExaniples:a) "I don't want Blacks living in my neighborhood!"b) "I don't want Jews owning businesses in my town!"c) "I don't want a Muslim community center in lower Manhattan!"These examples clearly show that there are prejudices going on. The statements prejudge against black people, Jews, andMuslims basically because of their race, nationality and religion Even though they have not done anything wrong yet, but becauseof their backgrounds, people tend to prejudge them and eventually discriminate them. These are very common in our society evenup to the present time.Another term that causes confusion and is often used interchangeably with "prejudice" is "bias". But these two termsdiffer from each other. Let's examine how it differs from the formerBias is a tendency to lean in a certain direction, either in favor of or against a particular thing. To be truly biased meansto lack a neutral viewpoint on a particular topic. Somewhere along the line, bias took on a negative connotation. If you're biasedtoward something, then you lean favorably toward it; you tend to think positively of it. Meanwhile, if you're biased againstsomething, then you lean negatively against it; you tend to think poorly of it.Examples:a) In other Christian sects, the preacher position is only given to niales and not to females.b) Sectarian schools only accept students who share the same religious beliefs.c) Sonie churches don't accept women who wear pants instead of dresses or skirts during their services.In the given examples, a certain group or people is given favor than the other. In number one, males are given morerower or authority than females. Number two, students who are interested to study in a school but don't share the same religioncan't be admitted. And lastly, women who want to attend church services aren't allowed to go if they don't wear the prescribedclothes for the said servicesANSWER THE FOLLOWING:Study and evaluate whether the given scenarios contain biases and prejudices. Write bias, prejudice, or none.1. Some Muslims are assumed to be terrorists and eventually being discriminated.2. Jews during the period of 'Hitler were sentenced to death because Hitler himself despised Jewish people.3. A teacher who gives good rating to her student who shares the same religious belief with her4. A married couple living in a new country where they are free to attend to any of their church services5. Tom Cruise's affiliation with Scientology prompts all kinds of negative press6. Not hiring someone because of their age or gender.7. Assuming someone is gay because of the way he acts.8.
