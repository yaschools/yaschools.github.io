                                            I like watching videos of black men shaking their booty cheeks. I don't know why, but when I watch videos of black men shaking their cheeks, my mouth starts to drool, and I dance with the black man as well. When I'm looking at the mirror, I sometimes hallucinate, and see a black man twerking on my couch, and that brings a smile to my face.</a>

                                            HOW THE WORLD BEGANA POPULAR BUKIDNON FOLKTALEA long, long time ago, when there was yet no world, there were three gods who lived in a small circular space of great brightness. Called a banting, and encircled by a rainbow, the space was just large enough for the two gods, Magbabaya and Dadanyahan, to sit across each other. The third god, the winged Makabughaw, sat precariously between the two, and had to flap his wings continuously to maintain his balance. Taking pity on Makabughaw, the one-headed Magbabaya (meaning your will be done) decided to build an extension so the poor Makabughaw could rest. To do this, he had to scoop soil from under the ten-headed Dadanyahan. He asked Makabughaw to do this for him. After studying the situation, Makabughaw swooped into Dadanyahans mouths and dived right through him so he could get soil from that point. He has the soil to Magbabaya who created earth from it.  But the earth was dry. How could it have turned lush and green? As Magbabaya puzzled over the problem, he happened to glance at Dadanyahans ten drooling mouths. Suddenly, he realized where he could get enough water to sprinkle over the earth. Dadanyahan agreed to the plan. Magbabaya blessed Dadanyahans saliva and the rain poured. Water washed over the earth. It shaped the mountains, hills, valleys, and plains; it made the streams, rivers and huge seas and oceans. Soon, vegetation began to sprout and grow. But this huge garden needed someone to take care of it. The two gods scooped some earth, and with the help from Dadanyahans saliva, turned it into sticky clay to form a figure. They collected wood for its bones, rattan from its blood vessels, and water for its blood. They molded seven figures in Magbabayas image. After the seventh figure was molded, Magbabaya had to leave to take care of a few other things. But before leaving, he told Dadanyahan not to tamper with the figures. Left alone with the figures, Dadanyahan could not help touching them up the way he thought they should look. Magbabaya returned to find Dadanyahan using his creative talents on the figures. This triggered a fight between them which Makabughaw tried to arbitrate in vain. The two gods dueled with each other until their metal weapons sank to the ground. These became the minerals that the human race later forged into its own weapons and mode of transport. Finally, the warring God reached an agreement. Because Dadanyahan had made the final form of the figures, he kept six figures while Magbabaya had only one since it was he who thought up the idea. Dadanyahans six figures became the various engkanto or guardians of the soil, water, and marine life, the plants, forests, and creatures of thej forest. Magbabayas lone figure became the first human being. The bits of clay cut from the figures as they were being modeled became the lower forms of animals. And thus did the world begin.Questions1. What was the beginning of the terrain of the earth, according to the legend? 2. What was the first human being made of? Why was it necessary to create humanbeings?3. Which character do you like best? Why? 4. How was solidarity shown in the story?5. How was solidarity shown in the story?​</a>

                                             The next week Mother become very ill.She was rushed to the hospital. I was allowed to see her only after a day Father said she was too weak to even speak. When l come in her hospital room i saw her hugging a doll . An awfully ugly little doll binked several times and raised its slimy little  hands to Mother. My Mother. What's THAT?lwrinkled my nose in disgust. Why honey, she's your little baby sister. You are a big brother now! And she hugged up again! Yuck My lips curled and i ran out out of the room. I wiped the tears that rolled down my cheeks. I was jealous. My father found me and scolded me. He said I should go and apologize to Mother for upsetting her After some spanking. I obeyed. I went book to her room "You're a liar. - you told me you love me. I do, sweetie.. Then, why? Aren't shouted at Mother. you happy you have a sister to play with a now "No." And that was that, Mother tried hard to establish ties between the ugly doll and me. But really don't ike it. 's no fun at all, not like Mother, I can't cimb trees, it can't run fast, it wets the bed it keeps on crying every time it trips and.it's always with Mother. It's stealing Mother away from me. Mother had two more ugly dolls the next year. She said they're "eye-dental things. Maybe because their eyes and teeth look the same. In fact, they looked like so much that I can't tell one ugly doll from another. I often saw Mother take different colored stones. Father said it should stop Mother from making more ugly dolls. But I didn't think that it worked because in the next seven years, nine screaming ugly dolls, some with long hair, others with short hair, surrounded me. Some are colored like chocolates, others milky, and still some are the color of coffee. There are thin ums and fat 'ums. but all of them are annoyingly noisy. And unbearably ugly, They even drool like my dog. Tagpi. I despised them all and I promised myself that when I grow up. i would develop a medicine to stop mothers from having ugly dolls. The witch doctors and faith healers in our town couldn't stop Mother from moking ugly dols. but I will. And now have grown up. In my quest to stop mothers from making ugly babies (my father threatened to stop me from schooling if i continue calling Mother's girls as ugly dolls. so now! call them ugly babies instead). I ended up in medical school. I become on obstetrician-gynecologist. I'm on my way to the delivery room for my first time to deliver an ugly baby. I still loathe babies. Ugly dolls that they are. Five hours later, I tapped the back of the newborn and a cry is heard. I stared at the helpless thing not realizing that tears are rolling down my cheeks again. This time, I smiled.

                            16. HOW THE WORLD BEGANA POPULAR BUKIDNON FOLKTALEA long, long time ago, when there was yet no world, there were three gods who lived in a small circular space of great brightness. Called a banting, and encircled by a rainbow, the space was just large enough for the two gods, Magbabaya and Dadanyahan, to sit across each other. The third god, the winged Makabughaw, sat precariously between the two, and had to flap his wings continuously to maintain his balance. Taking pity on Makabughaw, the one-headed Magbabaya (meaning your will be done) decided to build an extension so the poor Makabughaw could rest. To do this, he had to scoop soil from under the ten-headed Dadanyahan. He asked Makabughaw to do this for him. After studying the situation, Makabughaw swooped into Dadanyahans mouths and dived right through him so he could get soil from that point. He has the soil to Magbabaya who created earth from it.  But the earth was dry. How could it have turned lush and green? As Magbabaya puzzled over the problem, he happened to glance at Dadanyahans ten drooling mouths. Suddenly, he realized where he could get enough water to sprinkle over the earth. Dadanyahan agreed to the plan. Magbabaya blessed Dadanyahans saliva and the rain poured. Water washed over the earth. It shaped the mountains, hills, valleys, and plains; it made the streams, rivers and huge seas and oceans. Soon, vegetation began to sprout and grow. But this huge garden needed someone to take care of it. The two gods scooped some earth, and with the help from Dadanyahans saliva, turned it into sticky clay to form a figure. They collected wood for its bones, rattan from its blood vessels, and water for its blood. They molded seven figures in Magbabayas image. After the seventh figure was molded, Magbabaya had to leave to take care of a few other things. But before leaving, he told Dadanyahan not to tamper with the figures. Left alone with the figures, Dadanyahan could not help touching them up the way he thought they should look. Magbabaya returned to find Dadanyahan using his creative talents on the figures. This triggered a fight between them which Makabughaw tried to arbitrate in vain. The two gods dueled with each other until their metal weapons sank to the ground. These became the minerals that the human race later forged into its own weapons and mode of transport. Finally, the warring God reached an agreement. Because Dadanyahan had made the final form of the figures, he kept six figures while Magbabaya had only one since it was he who thought up the idea. Dadanyahans six figures became the various engkanto or guardians of the soil, water, and marine life, the plants, forests, and creatures of thej forest. Magbabayas lone figure became the first human being. The bits of clay cut from the figures as they were being modeled became the lower forms of animals. And thus did the world begin.Questions1. What was the beginning of the terrain of the earth, according to the legend? 2. What was the first human being made of? Why was it necessary to create humanbeings?3. Which character do you like best?

When l come in her hospital room i saw her hugging a doll . An awfully ugly little doll binked several times and raised its slimy little  hands to Mother. My Mother. What's THAT?lwrinkled my nose in disgust. Why honey, she's your little baby sister. You are a big brother now! And she hugged up again! Yuck My lips curled and i ran out out of the room. I wiped the tears that rolled down my cheeks. I was jealous. My father found me and scolded me. He said I should go and apologize to Mother for upsetting her After some spanking. I obeyed. I went book to her room "You're a liar. - you told me you love me. I do, sweetie.. Then, why? Aren't shouted at Mother. you happy you have a sister to play with a now "No." And that was that, Mother tried hard to establish ties between the ugly doll and me. But really don't ike it. 's no fun at all, not like Mother, I can't cimb trees, it can't run fast, it wets the bed it keeps on crying every time it trips and.it's always with Mother. It's stealing Mother away from me. Mother had two more ugly dolls the next year. She said they're "eye-dental things. Maybe because their eyes and teeth look the same. In fact, they looked like so much that I can't tell one ugly doll from another. I often saw Mother take different colored stones. Father said it should stop Mother from making more ugly dolls. But I didn't think that it worked because in the next seven years, nine screaming ugly dolls, some with long hair, others with short hair, surrounded me. Some are colored like chocolates, others milky, and still some are the color of coffee. There are thin ums and fat 'ums. but all of them are annoyingly noisy. And unbearably ugly, They even drool like my dog. Tagpi. I despised them all and I promised myself that when I grow up. i would develop a medicine to stop mothers from having ugly dolls. The witch doctors and faith healers in our town couldn't stop Mother from moking ugly dols. but I will. And now have grown up. In my quest to stop mothers from making ugly babies (my father threatened to stop me from schooling if i continue calling Mother's girls as ugly dolls. so now! call them ugly babies instead). I ended up in medical school. I become on obstetrician-gynecologist. I'm on my way to the delivery room for my first time to deliver an ugly baby. I still loathe babies. Ugly dolls that they are. Five hours later, I tapped the back of the newborn and a cry is heard. I stared at the helpless thing not realizing that tears are rolling down my cheeks again. This time, I smiled.
