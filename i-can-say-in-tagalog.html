                                            Travel offers you to offer a chance to enjoy life .You can meet fascinating people and experience  interesting cultures.I know some of us are doing some activities to prevent boredom  especially we  are facing the Corona Virus.Also I know that you really want to travel now but because of pandemic you cant,so im going to tour you in our municipality.Bantay Bell tower is one we are proud of not only because of its historical and cultural significance but also because of its commanding view of Vigan from the highest portion of it that can be climbed . It was said to be the people’s watchtower, part of the city’s defense that helps in alerting it against possible enemies. It was built in 1591.In my experience this belfry will like take you to you to the past and experience the breath taking view There is also one place here in our beloved Bantay that is also good for instagram because of its natural beauty and this is the Bicential Park of Bantay.This place was visited by some teenagers because its very relaxing and good for dating and bonding with family.I also go here and i can say that the view,the nature and the peacefulness was really incredible.This park was really good for those who want to relax and foget their problem for a meantime.This park was open for 5 am to 9 pm.And if youre hungry or thirsty theres some store that sells snacks and drinks. Bantay was one of the sources of rice because we are surrounded by farmland and my grandfather was also a farmer and im very proud of that,without them theres no rice we are eating right now.Twenty years from now you will be more dissapointed by the things you didn't do by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines .Catch the trade winds in your sails.Explore,Dream,Discover and be with our relaxing municality. Also I want to tell you this "Dont wanna sleep, don't wanna die,just wanna go travellin through the pastures of the sky.patulong itranslate sa tagalog please^_^​</a>

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </a>

                            13. Travel offers you to offer a chance to enjoy life .You can meet fascinating people and experience  interesting cultures.I know some of us are doing some activities to prevent boredom  especially we  are facing the Corona Virus.Also I know that you really want to travel now but because of pandemic you cant,so im going to tour you in our municipality.Bantay Bell tower is one we are proud of not only because of its historical and cultural significance but also because of its commanding view of Vigan from the highest portion of it that can be climbed . It was said to be the people’s watchtower, part of the city’s defense that helps in alerting it against possible enemies. It was built in 1591.In my experience this belfry will like take you to you to the past and experience the breath taking view There is also one place here in our beloved Bantay that is also good for instagram because of its natural beauty and this is the Bicential Park of Bantay.This place was visited by some teenagers because its very relaxing and good for dating and bonding with family.I also go here and i can say that the view,the nature and the peacefulness was really incredible.This park was really good for those who want to relax and foget their problem for a meantime.This park was open for 5 am to 9 pm.And if youre hungry or thirsty theres some store that sells snacks and drinks. Bantay was one of the sources of rice because we are surrounded by farmland and my grandfather was also a farmer and im very proud of that,without them theres no rice we are eating right now.Twenty years from now you will be more dissapointed by the things you didn't do by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines .Catch the trade winds in your sails.Explore,Dream,Discover and be with our relaxing municality.

                        <p></p><p>Case 2: Working Together</p><p></p><p>In the workplace, people from different backgrounds and cultures often work together. Despite any initial differences, working together can help build a stronger team and increase productivity. In this case, Jane, a British employee, and Ahmed, a Pakistani employee, were assigned to work on a project together.</p><p></p><p>At first, Jane and Ahmed had some difficulties communicating, as they had different communication styles and cultural norms. Jane tended to be more direct and assertive, while Ahmed was more reserved and polite. This led to some misunderstandings and tension between the two.</p><p></p><p>However, once they recognized and respected each other's styles, they were able to communicate more effectively and work together more smoothly. They found that by combining their different perspectives and approaches, they were able to come up with more creative solutions and produce higher-quality work.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, working together with people from different backgrounds and cultures can lead to a more successful and productive team. It is important to recognize and respect differences in communication styles and cultural norms, and to work towards finding common ground and combining different perspectives.</p><p></p><p>Case 5: What Can I Say?</p><p></p><p>In this case, Maria was a Mexican employee working with a team of American employees. Maria often found herself in situations where she was unsure of what to say or how to express herself in English.</p><p></p><p>Maria felt self-conscious and embarrassed when she struggled to find the right words or when her accent stood out. She was afraid of being judged or treated differently because of her language difficulties.</p><p></p><p>However, her colleagues were supportive and understanding, and they made an effort to help her feel more comfortable and confident. They would encourage her when she made progress in her language skills, and would make an effort to communicate with her in a way that she felt comfortable with.</p><p></p><p>Over time, Maria gained more confidence in her language abilities and felt more comfortable expressing herself in English. She also learned that it was okay to make mistakes and that her colleagues valued her contributions regardless of language difficulties.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, it is important to create a supportive and inclusive work environment where employees feel comfortable expressing themselves in their own unique way. Encouraging and supporting language learning and providing resources for language assistance can help employees feel more comfortable and confident in the workplace.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Case 2: Working Together</p><p></p><p>In this case, a group of students from diverse backgrounds were assigned to work on a project together. At first, they struggled with communication and cultural differences, but eventually, they learned to work together and appreciate each other's strengths.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>This case highlights the importance of teamwork and communication in achieving success. The students faced challenges due to their different backgrounds and experiences, but they were able to overcome these barriers by listening to each other, sharing their ideas, and finding common ground. This case demonstrates that diversity can bring unique perspectives and skills to a team, but it requires effort and understanding to work effectively together.</p><p></p><p>Case 5: What Can I Say?</p><p></p><p>In this case, a person is struggling to find the right words to comfort a friend who is going through a difficult time. They feel inadequate and unsure of what to say, and worry about making the situation worse.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>This case highlights the importance of empathy and active listening in supporting others. Sometimes, words alone cannot solve a problem, but being present and offering a listening ear can make a big difference. It's okay to not have all the answers or the perfect words, as long as we are genuine in our support and willing to offer our time and attention. This case reminds us that being there for someone in their time of need can be one of the most valuable things we can offer</p><br />

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Noong unang panahon, ang mga diyos lamang ang nabubuhay sa mundong ito, ang lupa, dagat, at langit ay pinamumunuan ng tatlong magkakaibang</p><p>makapangyarihang mga diyos. Ang diyos ng araw, na namuno sa langit, ay may isang napakagandang anak na babae, si Luna, ang buwan. Nag-enjoy si Luna</p><p>umiikot sa langit sakay ng kanyang gintong karo. Isang araw natagpuan niya ang kanyang sarili na tumahak sa ibang landas na humantong</p><p>sa labas ng kanyang kaharian. Naglakad-lakad siya hanggang sa marating niya ang lugar kung saan sinalubong ng langit ang dagat Maganda</p><p>at hindi pangkaraniwang tanawin ang sumalubong sa kanyang mga mata.</p><p>Habang hinahangaan niya ang mga magagandang bagay sa paligid, isang boses ang bumulaga sa kanya. Nagtanong ito, “Saan ka pupunta</p><p>galing sa pinaka maganda?" Paglingon niya ay nakita niya ang isang binata na kamukha ng kanyang ama</p><p>mas patas. Gusto niyang tumakas, ngunit nang muli siyang tumingin sa kanya, nakita niyang nakangiti ito sa kanya. Pagkuha</p><p>lakas ng loob niyang sumagot, "Ako si Luna, anak ng diyos ng araw." Ngumiti sa kanya ang binata at sumagot, “I</p><p>Ako si Mar, ang anak ng diyos ng dagat. Maligayang pagdating sa aming kaharian." Hindi nagtagal ay naging matalik na magkaibigan ang dalawa. Marami silang kawili-wiling kwento na sasabihin. Kapag oras na para sa</p><p>Luna to go, nangakong magkikita sila nang madalas hangga't maaari, dahil marami pa silang kwento sila</p><p>Nagpatuloy ang pagkikita sa iisang lugar hanggang sa napagtanto nilang in love na sila sa isa't isa.</p><p>Isang araw pagkatapos ng isa sa kanilang mga lihim na pagkikita, bumalik si Luna sa langit na puno ng kagalakan. Siya ay gayon</p><p>masaya na sinabi niya ang sikreto niya sa isa niyang pinsan. Ang pinsan, naninibugho sa kanyang kagandahan at kanyang kaligayahan, iniulat ang relasyon sa diyos ng araw. Nagalit ang diyos ng araw sa pagsuway ng kanyang anak sa imortal</p><p>mga batas. Isinara niya siya sa kanilang hardin at hindi siya pinayagang makalabas. Pagkatapos ay umuwi siyang malungkot. Sa tuwing naaalala niya si Mar, nagmamadali siyang lumabas sa ginto</p><p>kalesa patungo sa tagpuan sa pag-asang makita siyang muli. Ang mga mangingisda sa labas ng dagat ay naniniwala na sa bawat oras</p><p>Lumilitaw si Luna, ang buwan, nagugulo ang dagat. Si Mar ang sumusubok na tumakas sa kanyang kweba,” sabi nila.</p><br />

Suppose all the instruments will only play the melody of the piece, what do you think will be your general impression about the piece? 4. How does the dynamics of the piece affect its overall sound? Which is better, a piece with dynamics or without dynamics? Why? 5. If ever you will choose your roldalla instrument, what will it be? Why? 6. After listening each given folksong, how would you differentiate the characteristics of the Tagalog, Ilocano, and Bicolano folksongs?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) Melody is a timely arranged linear sequence of pitched sounds that the listener perceives as a single entity. Melody is one of the most basic elements of music. A note is a sound with a particular pitch and duration. String a series of notes together, one after the other, and you have a melody.</p><p></p><p>2) constructive way to express who you are and what you are feeling, especially in young children. It can often be difficult for children to say how they are feeling, primarily because they don’t know the name of the feeling they’re experiencing and instead they show us by crying, throwing temper tantrums, or having meltdowns. Emotional expression is something that must be learned, and young children can be taught basic emotions such as happy, mad, sad, and scared as early as two years old.</p><p></p><p>3) Melodies are produced through the human voice and any other instrument that produces pitches––marimbas, flutes, synthesizers, glockenspiels, guitars, etc.</p><p></p><p>4) Dynamics effects alter the volume of sound (that is, attenuate it) once it crosses the threshold. The amount it attenuates the sound is called the ratio. The higher the ratio, the more the effect will attenuate the sound.</p><p></p><p>5) Learning a musical instrument not only sustains and feeds the brain, but it also improves so many other cognitive and physical aspects of the human body. It's been widely studied and proven that learning a musical instrument improves memory; it not only improves your cognitive memory but also muscle memory as well.</p><p></p><p>6) When we sing folk songs it connects us with the generations who have come before us as well as other cultures from around the world. We follow in their footsteps and gather together because of our love for singing and dancing. Folk songs are also great because they make it so easy to teach history and culture</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
