                                            Long ago, when the various kinds of animals dwelt together in a kind of community, a dalag (a kind of mud-fish), a dragonfly, a wasp, and a snail agreed to live together in a common house. They furthermore agreed to divide up the different household duties according to their power and skill.
Accordingly, Dalag, since he was the biggest and strongest of all, was made the head of the house. He was also to provide food for his little companions.
Dragon-Fly was made the messenger because he was the swiftest of them all, but was too weak for any other kind of work.
Wasp was made the house-guard because of his poisonous sting. Besides being guard, he was also to keep the house in repair because he could carry bits of earth and other building-materials.
Snail was made the cook because he was too slow for any other duty except tending the house.
Early one day Dalag went out to look for food. He swam slowly here and there among the water-plants when suddenly he saw something moving on the surface of the water.
When he approached nearer, he saw that it was a big frog swimming helplessly among the duck-weeds. “This is a big piece of sweet food for us,” thought Dalag, and without hesitation he seized the frog. When he had assured himself that it could not get away from him, he started to swim home. But, alas! he never reached his companions, for a sharp hook was inside the frog, and poor Dalag was caught fast. He tried hard to free himself, but in vain. Soon a fisherman came and, putting Dalag in his basket, took him home and ate him.
In the meantime, Dalag’s three companions were anxiously waiting for him. When they realized that he was lost, Dragon-Fly was sent out to look for him. Before he went, Dragon-Fly spent a long time arranging his neck-tie. Then he flew away, turning his head in all directions to look for Dalag.
At last he met Bolasi (a kind of fish whose lips always move in and out on the surface of the water), and he became very angry because he thought that Bolasi was laughing at his neck-tie. Dragon-Fly thought that his tie must be too loose, so he tightened it. Still Bolasi laughed every time he saw Dragon-Fly. Dragon-Fly kept drawing his tie tighter and tighter until at last he cut his own head off, and that was the end of him.
Two days had now passed; still Dalag and Dragon-Fly were missing from home. By this time Wasp and Snail were very hungry. But Snail had the advantage over Wasp, for Snail could eat mud to pass away the time, while Wasp could not eat mud but could only draw in his belt a little tighter. At last Wasp could no longer endure his hunger. His abdomen by this time had become very slender, so he flew forth in search of either Dalag or Dragon-Fly. While he was flying about, his hunger oppressed him so much that he tightened his belt again and again until he finally broke in two, and that was the end of Wasp.
Now only Snail was left. He set out from his home and wandered everywhere in search of his three companions, weeping as he went. His food consisted mostly of mud. Whenever he could find a stalk of grass or the stem of a water-plant, Snail would climb up to look around and to see if any of his old friends were in sight.
Even today the snails still weep, and whenever they see a stalk of grass projecting above the surface of the water, they climb up and look around, trying to discover their old friends.

                                            The Princess in the Sky Long, long ago, says an old Indian story, there were no rivers in India. All the places below the mountains were very flat. In the hot weather, the land became so dry that no plants would grow. Up in Himalayan mountains dwelt the god, Siva. Above him in the sky lived the beautiful Princess Ganga. Ganga was soft and gentle. Sometimes, she looked down on the plain below and wept to see how the sun had burnt up all the land. As her tears fell on the soil, crops began to grow. "If only Ganga would come down among us," the people would cry, "then perhaps we should have more food to eat." One day, a holy man prayed to Siva on the mountaintop and asked him to bring Princess Ganga down to earth. "Your prayer is answered," replied the god, and he asked the princess if she was willing to do as the people wished. "I will come," she answered. She floated gently down from the cloud where she lived. She reached first the mountaintop where Siva had his dwelling. Now, Siva was a large god with long, long hair, which often blew out like a net in the strong winds that howled round the peaks of the Himalayas. Princess Ganga was caught in this net. Siva knew many magic spells, but he had never come across a spell that would set free a prisoner in his own hair. Ganga struggled in vain. As she struggled, the jewels in her white robe were scattered all over the mountaintops. That, says the story, is why the tops of the Himalayas are always white. At last, the princess thought of a way to release herself. She begged Siva to turn her into water, so that she could slip easily through the net of his hair. The god did as she asked.​</a>

                                            What is the plot diagram for this story 
Long ago, when the various kinds of animals dwelt together in a kind of community, a dalag (a kind of mud-fish), a dragonfly, a wasp, and a snail agreed to live together in a common house. They furthermore agreed to divide up the different household duties according to their power and skill.
Accordingly, Dalag, since he was the biggest and strongest of all, was made the head of the house. He was also to provide food for his little companions.
Dragon-Fly was made the messenger because he was the swiftest of them all, but was too weak for any other kind of work.
Wasp was made the house-guard because of his poisonous sting. Besides being guard, he was also to keep the house in repair because he could carry bits of earth and other building-materials.
Snail was made the cook because he was too slow for any other duty except tending the house.
Early one day Dalag went out to look for food. He swam slowly here and there among the water-plants when suddenly he saw something moving on the surface of the water.
When he approached nearer, he saw that it was a big frog swimming helplessly among the duck-weeds. “This is a big piece of sweet food for us,” thought Dalag, and without hesitation he seized the frog. When he had assured himself that it could not get away from him, he started to swim home. But, alas! he never reached his companions, for a sharp hook was inside the frog, and poor Dalag was caught fast. He tried hard to free himself, but in vain. Soon a fisherman came and, putting Dalag in his basket, took him home and ate him.
In the meantime, Dalag’s three companions were anxiously waiting for him. When they realized that he was lost, Dragon-Fly was sent out to look for him. Before he went, Dragon-Fly spent a long time arranging his neck-tie. Then he flew away, turning his head in all directions to look for Dalag.
At last he met Bolasi (a kind of fish whose lips always move in and out on the surface of the water), and he became very angry because he thought that Bolasi was laughing at his neck-tie. Dragon-Fly thought that his tie must be too loose, so he tightened it. Still Bolasi laughed every time he saw Dragon-Fly. Dragon-Fly kept drawing his tie tighter and tighter until at last he cut his own head off, and that was the end of him.
Two days had now passed; still Dalag and Dragon-Fly were missing from home. By this time Wasp and Snail were very hungry. But Snail had the advantage over Wasp, for Snail could eat mud to pass away the time, while Wasp could not eat mud but could only draw in his belt a little tighter. At last Wasp could no longer endure his hunger. His abdomen by this time had become very slender, so he flew forth in search of either Dalag or Dragon-Fly. While he was flying about, his hunger oppressed him so much that he tightened his belt again and again until he finally broke in two, and that was the end of Wasp.
Now only Snail was left. He set out from his home and wandered everywhere in search of his three companions, weeping as he went. His food consisted mostly of mud. Whenever he could find a stalk of grass or the stem of a water-plant, Snail would climb up to look around and to see if any of his old friends were in sight.
Even today the snails still weep, and whenever they see a stalk of grass projecting above the surface of the water, they climb up and look around, trying to discover their old friends.</a>

Whence these legends and traditions, With the odors of the forest With the dew and damp of meadows,With the curling smoke of wigwams,With the rushing of great rivers,With their frequent repetitions,And their wild reverberationsAs of thunder in the mountains?  I should answer, I should tell you,"From the forests and the prairies,From the great lakes of the Northland,From the land of the Ojibways,From the land of the Dacotahs,From the mountains, moors, and fen-landsWhere the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,Feeds among the reeds and rushes.I repeat them as I heard themFrom the lips of Nawadaha,The musician, the sweet singer."  Should you ask where NawadahaFound these songs so wild and wayward,Found these legends and traditions,I should answer, I should tell you,"In the bird's-nests of the forest,In the lodges of the beaver,In the hoof-prints of the bison,In the eyry of the eagle!  "All the wild-fowl sang them to him,In the moorlands and the fen-lands,In the melancholy marshes;Chetowaik, the plover, sang them,Mahng, the loon, the wild-goose, Wawa,The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,And the grouse, the Mushkodasa!"  If still further you should ask me,Saying, "Who was Nawadaha?Tell us of this Nawadaha,"I should answer your inquiriesStraightway in such words as follow.  "In the vale of Tawasentha,In the green and silent valley,By the pleasant water-courses,Dwelt the singer Nawadaha.Round about the Indian villageSpread the meadows and the corn-fields,And beyond them stood the forest,Stood the groves of singing pine-trees,Green in Summer, white in Winter,Ever sighing, ever singing.  "And the pleasant water-courses,You could trace them through the valley,By the rushing in the Spring-time,By the alders in the Summer,By the white fog in the Autumn,By the black line in the Winter;And beside them dwelt the singer,In the vale of Tawasentha,In the green and silent valley.  "There he sang of Hiawatha,Sang the Song of Hiawatha,Sang his wondrous birth and being,How he prayed and how be fasted,How he lived, and toiled, and suffered,That the tribes of men might prosper,That he might advance his people!"  Ye who love the haunts of Nature,Love the sunshine of the meadow,Love the shadow of the forest,Love the wind among the branches,And the rain-shower and the snow-storm,And the rushing of great riversThrough their palisades of pine-trees,And the thunder in the mountains,Whose innumerable echoesFlap like eagles in their eyries;--Listen to these wild traditions,To this Song of Hiawatha!  Ye who love a nation's legends,Love the ballads of a people,That like voices from afar offCall to us to pause and listen,Speak in tones so plain and childlike,Scarcely can the ear distinguishWhether they are sung or spoken;--Listen to this Indian Legend,To this Song of Hiawatha!  Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple,Who have faith in God and Nature,Who believe that in all agesEvery human heart is human,That in even savage bosomsThere are longings, yearnings, strivingsFor the good they comprehend not,That the feeble hands and helpless,Groping blindly in the darkness,Touch God's right hand in that darknessAnd are lifted up and strengthened;--Listen to this simple story,To this Song of Hiawatha!  Ye, who sometimes, in your ramblesThrough the green lanes of the country,Where the tangled barberry-bushesHang their tufts of crimson berriesOver stone walls gray with mosses,Pause by some neglected graveyard,For a while to muse, and ponderOn a half-effaced inscription,Written with little skill of song-craft,Homely phrases, but each letterFull of hope and yet of heart-break,Full of all the tender pathosOf the Here and the Hereafter;--Stay and read this rude inscription,Read this Song of Hiawatha!​</a>

Even today the snails still weep, and whenever they see a stalk of grass projecting above the surface of the water, they climb up and look around, trying to discover their old friends.

But she is in her grave, and, oh,

                            11. The Princess in the Sky Long, long ago, says an old Indian story, there were no rivers in India. All the places below the mountains were very flat. In the hot weather, the land became so dry that no plants would grow. Up in Himalayan mountains dwelt the god, Siva. Above him in the sky lived the beautiful Princess Ganga. Ganga was soft and gentle. Sometimes, she looked down on the plain below and wept to see how the sun had burnt up all the land. As her tears fell on the soil, crops began to grow. "If only Ganga would come down among us," the people would cry, "then perhaps we should have more food to eat." One day, a holy man prayed to Siva on the mountaintop and asked him to bring Princess Ganga down to earth. "Your prayer is answered," replied the god, and he asked the princess if she was willing to do as the people wished. "I will come," she answered. She floated gently down from the cloud where she lived. She reached first the mountaintop where Siva had his dwelling. Now, Siva was a large god with long, long hair, which often blew out like a net in the strong winds that howled round the peaks of the Himalayas. Princess Ganga was caught in this net. Siva knew many magic spells, but he had never come across a spell that would set free a prisoner in his own hair. Ganga struggled in vain. As she struggled, the jewels in her white robe were scattered all over the mountaintops. That, says the story, is why the tops of the Himalayas are always white. At last, the princess thought of a way to release herself. She begged Siva to turn her into water, so that she could slip easily through the net of his hair. The god did as she asked.​</h2><br />

                            14. What is the plot diagram for this story 
Long ago, when the various kinds of animals dwelt together in a kind of community, a dalag (a kind of mud-fish), a dragonfly, a wasp, and a snail agreed to live together in a common house. They furthermore agreed to divide up the different household duties according to their power and skill.
Accordingly, Dalag, since he was the biggest and strongest of all, was made the head of the house. He was also to provide food for his little companions.
Dragon-Fly was made the messenger because he was the swiftest of them all, but was too weak for any other kind of work.
Wasp was made the house-guard because of his poisonous sting. Besides being guard, he was also to keep the house in repair because he could carry bits of earth and other building-materials.
Snail was made the cook because he was too slow for any other duty except tending the house.
Early one day Dalag went out to look for food. He swam slowly here and there among the water-plants when suddenly he saw something moving on the surface of the water.
When he approached nearer, he saw that it was a big frog swimming helplessly among the duck-weeds. “This is a big piece of sweet food for us,” thought Dalag, and without hesitation he seized the frog. When he had assured himself that it could not get away from him, he started to swim home. But, alas! he never reached his companions, for a sharp hook was inside the frog, and poor Dalag was caught fast. He tried hard to free himself, but in vain. Soon a fisherman came and, putting Dalag in his basket, took him home and ate him.
In the meantime, Dalag’s three companions were anxiously waiting for him. When they realized that he was lost, Dragon-Fly was sent out to look for him. Before he went, Dragon-Fly spent a long time arranging his neck-tie. Then he flew away, turning his head in all directions to look for Dalag.
At last he met Bolasi (a kind of fish whose lips always move in and out on the surface of the water), and he became very angry because he thought that Bolasi was laughing at his neck-tie. Dragon-Fly thought that his tie must be too loose, so he tightened it. Still Bolasi laughed every time he saw Dragon-Fly. Dragon-Fly kept drawing his tie tighter and tighter until at last he cut his own head off, and that was the end of him.
Two days had now passed; still Dalag and Dragon-Fly were missing from home. By this time Wasp and Snail were very hungry. But Snail had the advantage over Wasp, for Snail could eat mud to pass away the time, while Wasp could not eat mud but could only draw in his belt a little tighter. At last Wasp could no longer endure his hunger. His abdomen by this time had become very slender, so he flew forth in search of either Dalag or Dragon-Fly. While he was flying about, his hunger oppressed him so much that he tightened his belt again and again until he finally broke in two, and that was the end of Wasp.
Now only Snail was left. He set out from his home and wandered everywhere in search of his three companions, weeping as he went. His food consisted mostly of mud. Whenever he could find a stalk of grass or the stem of a water-plant, Snail would climb up to look around and to see if any of his old friends were in sight.
Even today the snails still weep, and whenever they see a stalk of grass projecting above the surface of the water, they climb up and look around, trying to discover their old friends.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>life circle of dragonfly</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Dragonflies have been around for 300 million years, making them one of the oldest species of insects in the world. Dragonflies have been so successful over the years that the only difference between modern and ancient dragonflies is size. One of the secrets to their success is how they mature. Dragonflies have three stages to their life: egg, nymph and adult. The length of each stage depends on the species of dragonfly. Dragonflies in tropical regions typically spend less time in each stage than dragonflies in temperate regions.</p><br />

Sometimes, she looked down on the plain crops began to grow. "If only Ganga would come down among us." the people would cr erhaps we should have more food to eat." One day, a holy man prayed to Siva on the mountaintop and aske ng Princess Ganga down to earth. "Your prayer is answered," replied the god, and he asked the prince willing to do as the people wished.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Long, long ago, says an old Indian story, there were no rivers in India.Up in the Himalayan mountains dwelt the god, Siva.Above him lived the beautiful Princess Ganga.As her tears fell on the land below the mountains, crops began to grow.One day, a holy man prayed to Siva on the mountaintop and asked Princess Ganga down to earth."Your prayer is answered," replied the god, and he asked the princess if she was willing to do as the people wished."I will come," she answered.She floated gently down from the cloud where she lived.She reached the plain where the people lived and the river Ganges was formed.Now, Siva was a large god with long, tangled hair, which often blew out like a net in the strong winds that howled around the Himalayas.Princess Ganga was caught in this net.<p></p><br />

                            17. find the tone, imagery, style, and theme" The music of Hiawatha"Should you ask me, whence these stories? Whence these legends and traditions, With the odors of the forest With the dew and damp of meadows,With the curling smoke of wigwams,With the rushing of great rivers,With their frequent repetitions,And their wild reverberationsAs of thunder in the mountains?  I should answer, I should tell you,"From the forests and the prairies,From the great lakes of the Northland,From the land of the Ojibways,From the land of the Dacotahs,From the mountains, moors, and fen-landsWhere the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,Feeds among the reeds and rushes.I repeat them as I heard themFrom the lips of Nawadaha,The musician, the sweet singer."  Should you ask where NawadahaFound these songs so wild and wayward,Found these legends and traditions,I should answer, I should tell you,"In the bird's-nests of the forest,In the lodges of the beaver,In the hoof-prints of the bison,In the eyry of the eagle!  "All the wild-fowl sang them to him,In the moorlands and the fen-lands,In the melancholy marshes;Chetowaik, the plover, sang them,Mahng, the loon, the wild-goose, Wawa,The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,And the grouse, the Mushkodasa!"  If still further you should ask me,Saying, "Who was Nawadaha?Tell us of this Nawadaha,"I should answer your inquiriesStraightway in such words as follow.  "In the vale of Tawasentha,In the green and silent valley,By the pleasant water-courses,Dwelt the singer Nawadaha.Round about the Indian villageSpread the meadows and the corn-fields,And beyond them stood the forest,Stood the groves of singing pine-trees,Green in Summer, white in Winter,Ever sighing, ever singing.  "And the pleasant water-courses,You could trace them through the valley,By the rushing in the Spring-time,By the alders in the Summer,By the white fog in the Autumn,By the black line in the Winter;And beside them dwelt the singer,In the vale of Tawasentha,In the green and silent valley.  "There he sang of Hiawatha,Sang the Song of Hiawatha,Sang his wondrous birth and being,How he prayed and how be fasted,How he lived, and toiled, and suffered,That the tribes of men might prosper,That he might advance his people!"  Ye who love the haunts of Nature,Love the sunshine of the meadow,Love the shadow of the forest,Love the wind among the branches,And the rain-shower and the snow-storm,And the rushing of great riversThrough their palisades of pine-trees,And the thunder in the mountains,Whose innumerable echoesFlap like eagles in their eyries;--Listen to these wild traditions,To this Song of Hiawatha!  Ye who love a nation's legends,Love the ballads of a people,That like voices from afar offCall to us to pause and listen,Speak in tones so plain and childlike,Scarcely can the ear distinguishWhether they are sung or spoken;--Listen to this Indian Legend,To this Song of Hiawatha!  Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple,Who have faith in God and Nature,Who believe that in all agesEvery human heart is human,That in even savage bosomsThere are longings, yearnings, strivingsFor the good they comprehend not,That the feeble hands and helpless,Groping blindly in the darkness,Touch God's right hand in that darknessAnd are lifted up and strengthened;--Listen to this simple story,To this Song of Hiawatha!  Ye, who sometimes, in your ramblesThrough the green lanes of the country,Where the tangled barberry-bushesHang their tufts of crimson berriesOver stone walls gray with mosses,Pause by some neglected graveyard,For a while to muse, and ponderOn a half-effaced inscription,Written with little skill of song-craft,Homely phrases, but each letterFull of hope and yet of heart-break,Full of all the tender pathosOf the Here and the Hereafter;--Stay and read this rude inscription,Read this Song of Hiawatha!​</h2><br />
