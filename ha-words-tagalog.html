Indeed, how heartbreaking and devasting to only hear from the word "unemployment". But what more could it be when we learn further about it? What does "unemployment" really mean? Is it just the lack of one's source of living? Or is there more to it than just that? What are the news and articles pertaining to it trying to address? What are they trying to imply? What happens to those affected by this certain issue? The people, their families, status, lifestyle, their country? And oh, the economy. A lot of questions linger in our minds, leaving us a mark on what "unemployment" really is, and how far it can go and affect us. These questions, they add up and increase; yet, they remain unanswered. Thus, the making of this essay has a major goal of fulfilling the thoughts, untiringly lingering in our minds about the true essence of "unemployment", its aspects, effects, how to cope with it, and more.​</a>

                                            a The Philippines is known as the festive capital of the world. Every place in the country has a festival of its own. As such, every 30th of April, Lopezenos celebrates the "Pamaypayan Festival" as its annual festival celebrating its good harvest and a year full of blessings. It originated from the term "pamaypay" the native Tagalog word for fan, which is used to cool oneself in hot weather. This pamaypay comes in different colors and sizes. Pamaypayan is a place or house for the weavers of Pamaypay. As their one-town-one product (OTOP), it promotes pamaypay and its sub-products, such as hats, bags, slippers, and costumes made of anahaw, buli, and indigenous materials. The festival also aims to promote the weavers of pamaypay who could transform the commodity they produced into a highly valuable product that is not only known in the local but also the international market. need napo ​</a>

                                            What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</a>

It originated from the term "pamaypay" the native Tagalog word for fan, which is used to cool oneself in hot weather. This pamaypay comes in different colors and sizes. Pamaypayan is a place or house for the weavers of Pamaypay. As their one-town-one product (OTOP), it promotes pamaypay and its sub-products, such as hats, bags, slippers, and costumes made of anahaw, buli, and indigenous materials. The festival also aims to promote the weavers of pamaypay who could transform the commodity they produced into a highly valuable product that is not only known in the local but also the international market. need napo ​</h2><br />

                            30. What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</h2><br />
