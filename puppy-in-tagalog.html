                                            Randy found a puppy on his way home. Thinking it had no owner, he brought the puppy home. The puppy was playful, and it learns fast. He liked the puppy so much. One day, he passed an old tree with a poster of puppy missing. It was the same puppy he found. He was hesitant at first but decided to return the puppy to its owner. The owner thanked Randy for taking good care of the puppy. Question: Do you agree with Randy’s decision to return the puppy to its owner? Explain your answer in 2-3 sentences.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Kahulugan ng Puppy Love<p>Ang <strong>puppy love</strong> ay isang mababaw na pag-ibig o pagmamahal na maari mong maramdaman para sa isang tao. Kapag nakaramdam ka nito para sa isang tao, maaring hindi pa ito seryoso at totoong pagmamahal, tila pagkakaroon lamang ito ng paghanga para sa kanya dahil sa pansariling kadahilanan. Ang ganitong klase ng pagmamahal ay maari pang mawala at mapalitan.
</p><p></p>Love
<p>Ang <strong>pag-ibig o love</strong> ay isang pakiramdam o espesyal na mararamdaman o nararamdaman para sa isang tao, maging sa iyong kaibigan, sa iyong kapwa, sa iyong pamilya at higit sa lahat sa Panginoon na nagbigay sa atin ng buhay at nagturo sa ating lahat kung paano magmahal.
</p><p></p><p>Tayong lahat ay nabuo dahil sa <strong>pag-ibig </strong>sa ating ng Diyos, nilikha niya si Eva at si Adan upang maging kawangis niya sa paglikha ng mga tao. Tayo ay nilikha sa pamamagitan ng pag-ibig at pagmamahalan na mayroon ang ating mga magulang. Ang pag-ibig o love ay para sa lahat. Para sa lahat ng nilikha ng Diyos.
</p><p></p><p>Ang <strong>pagmamahal</strong> ay kusang nararamdaman at kusa rin itong bininigay.  Kapag nagmahal ka dapat hindi ka naghihintay ng kahit anumang kapalit dahil ito ay kusang loob mong naramdaman para sa isang tao. Nararapat na marunong tayong makuntento sa taong mahal natin. Kapag nagmamahal ka dapat handa kang magpatawad, umunawa at magsakripisyo. Magsakripisyo sa mga bagay na mayroon ka at kinahiligan mo para sa isang taong mahal mo.
</p><p></p><p>Ang <strong>pagmamahal</strong> ay hindi madamot o makasarili kapag tunay mong mahal ang isang tao kapag hinahayaan mo siya sa mga bagay na makapagpapasaya sa kanya. Ang pagmamahal ay  hindi nasusukat sa liit o laki ng pagkatao, sa estado sa buhay, sa edad, sa kulay, balat o relehiyon dahil wala itong pinipili, pwede nating iparamdam at ibigay ang ating pagmamahal sa kahit sino.
</p><p></p><p>Kakambal ng <strong>pagmamahal</strong> ang sakit. Kapag ikaw ay nagmamahal, dapat handa kang masaktan. Dahil dito, magiging buo at mahuhulma ang iyong pagkatao. Ito ang magtuturo sa atin para tayo ay maging matatag at malakas. Kaya huwag mong panghinayangan ang panahon at pagkakataon na nawala sa iyo bagkus magpasalamat dahil naramdaman mo ang isang tunay at busilak na pagmamahal para sa ibang tao.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Have you ever opened your closet and thought to yourself, ''I have nothing to wear?'' You might be surprised to learn that if you had just three shirts and two pairs of pants, you actually have six different outfits that you could wear. Suppose you have a black shirt, a brown shirt, and a white shirt, and you also have a pair of jeans and a pair of black pants. How could we make 6 outfits?
</p><p>
</p><p>Well, if you decided to wear the black shirt, you could choose to wear jeans or the black pants, which gives us two possible outfits. If you decided to wear the brown shirt, again you could choose to wear jeans or the black pants. Again, that gives us two possible outfits, with a total of four possible outfits. You might decide to wear the white shirt, and you could choose either jeans or black pants. These two options now give us a total of six possible outfits. We can multiply the number of shirts (3) times the number of pants (2) to get the 6 total possible outcomes.
</p><p>
</p><p>The best way to see all these possibilities is to use a tree diagram. A tree diagram is a visual way to represent the total outcomes you could have. You can see this laid out in the diagram on your screen below.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><strong>Hope it helps</strong><strong>Paki brianliest po</strong><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
</p><p>
</p><p>[2] And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
</p><p>
</p><p>[3] And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
</p><p>
</p><p>[4] And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
</p><p>
</p><p>[5] And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
</p><p>
</p><p>[6] And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
</p><p>
</p><p>[7] And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
</p><p>
</p><p>[8] And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
</p><p>
</p><p>[9] And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
</p><p>
</p><p>[10] And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
</p><p>
</p><p>[11] And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
</p><p>
</p><p>[12] And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
</p><p>
</p><p>[13] And the evening and the morning were the third day.
</p><p>
</p><p>[14] And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
</p><p>
</p><p>[15] And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
</p><p>
</p><p>[16] And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

</p><p>[17] And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,

</p><p>[21] And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
</p><p>
</p><p>[22] And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
</p><p>
</p><p>[23] And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
</p><p>
</p><p>[24] And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
</p><p>
</p><p>[25] And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
</p><p>
</p><p>[26] And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
</p><p>
</p><p>[27] So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
</p><p>
</p><p>[28] And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
</p><p>
</p><p>[29] And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
</p><p>
</p><p>[30] And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
</p><p>
</p><p>[31] And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:Answer:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Have you ever opened your closet and thought to yourself, ''I have nothing to wear?'' You might be surprised to learn that if you had just three shirts and two pairs of pants, you actually have six different outfits that you could wear. Suppose you have a black shirt, a brown shirt, and a white shirt, and you also have a pair of jeans and a pair of black pants. How could we make 6 outfits?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Well, if you decided to wear the black shirt, you could choose to wear jeans or the black pants, which gives us two possible outfits. If you decided to wear the brown shirt, again you could choose to wear jeans or the black pants. Again, that gives us two possible outfits, with a total of four possible outfits. You might decide to wear the white shirt, and you could choose either jeans or black pants. These two options now give us a total of six possible outfits. We can multiply the number of shirts (3) times the number of pants (2) to get the 6 total possible outcomes.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The best way to see all these possibilities is to use a tree diagram. A tree diagram is a visual way to represent the total outcomes you could have. You can see this laid out in the diagram on your screen below.
