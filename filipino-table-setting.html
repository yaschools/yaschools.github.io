Some enjoy it with scrambled egg or hotdog, while others fill it with butter or jam. Still others prefer toasted pan de sal with margarine. There are many ways to enjoy pan de sal at every Filipino table. 2.) Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. There is coolness, calmness, when the sun does set. 3.) Man is a social being. Every day, she/he interacts with others in the community. He/She meets different people in varied situations and necessities to survive. Just like students go to school and learn from their teachers. Parents go to the office and work with their officemates. Drivers pick up passengers. Vendors sell their merchandise to various customers. An individual encounters different people day in and day out. Thus, a person should learn how to mingle with others in positive ways so that people would establish healthy relationships among themselves.​</a>

                                            Family Cook By Alma Anonas-Carpio All Soul’s Day means the family will be over to partake of the family feast of favorites. Lolo Cholo’s caldereta, Lola Ninay’s Sinigang na Ulo sa Miso. Tito Pascualito’s Beef Tapa con Ampalaya will make its first appearance at the table this year, beside the box of Krispy Kreme chocolate donuts young Paquito used to scarf down when his chemo permitted. Saling set a furious pace for herself. She had kare-kare from scratch to prepare for the clan and she had but a few more hours to get it done as she’d always gotten it done: Perfect, hot, served with spicy shrimp paste she’d sauteed from scratch with bird’s eye chilies from the backyard. There’s the leche flan to chill yet, she thinks as her cook’s knife decimates the banana hearts on the chopping board. Her hands fly over the talyasi in the yard sitting on its roaring wood fire, testing the heat before she begins the process of making the perfect oxtail in peanut sauce stew. The family will want this dish as she makes it each year: The meat fork-tender, the sauce rich and sinful. After all, this is the one time in the year she gets to make it for everyone. Decades of love in a huge wok, the simmering heart of her, this is the best expression of love Saling knows—and she never fails to express it with piquancy, with heat, with all her heart and soul poured into every morsel and drip of sauce. Saling pops the flans in the ref and moves on to the sink to wash up. It just wouldn’t do to leave the care of her precious cookware to the kids. Might as well do this while the stew simmers. Somewhere in the yard, a time-addled rooster crows at the witching hour. Saling turns her face up to the ebbing moonlight filtering into the outdoor kitchen. She closes her eyes as she calls the names of every clan member over the slow-bubbling kare-kare, dropping the okra and pechay in carefully, giving the lot a final firm stir before setting the lid on the huge wok. Saling takes a few minutes to look at each window of the old house where she’d spent the happiest moments and some of the most difficult days of her life. Breaking her reverie, she ladles the stew into large clay pots and sets them and the little sauce-bowls of sauteed shrimp-fry out on the buffet table set up in the ancestral home’s sala (the family always set that up ahead of time, of course), her smile tired, but so very satisfied. 1.

                                            Activity No. 2: Read the selection and fill in the table with the similarities and differences of "Ibalon" and "Overseas Filipino Workers as Everyday Heroes" by searching for appropriate resources to be able to have additional information. Be sure to provide and cite your sources. Use another paper as your answer sheet. Overseas Filipino Workers as Everyday Heroes 1 Overseas Filipino Workers take a huge risk when they travel and work abroad. OFWs sacrifice a lot in order to give a better life for their families. They are heroes in their own right because they live to help their families and sometimes even other people they do not even know, but are in need of their help and support. 2 Heroes think of other people first before they think of themselves. Heroes are unique individuals that sacrifice themselves for the sake of others. OFWs face great challenges head on with only their faith, hope, and determination to carry them through. They strive hard to ensure that their children's future would be bright and that they would live a life that they have dreamed of. 3 What are OFWs made of? They are made of determination, courage, a risk-taking attitude, a heart of gold, and other qualities that make them everyday heroes to a lot of people. They go beyond their call of duty to help their families, to help their country and sometimes people in need, even if it means putting themselves in danger. 4 You do not have to be an OFW to be a hero. You are a hero if you sacrifice a part of yourself to help other people who are in need. You are a hero if you can make someone else smile despite the trials and challenges he has. You are a hero if you can make others feel better about themselves. If you do any of these, then you are a hero in a person's heart.  Theme   ibalon  OFW as Everyday HeroesSetting  ​</a>

Write its connection to your personal experiences, to your community, or to the world by completing the table below. Bayanihan is a Filipino term referring to the spirit of communal unity and cooperation. It was derived from the word bayan which means nation or community. It became a known trait of the Filipinos and was practiced by Filipinos until now. Bayanihan can be viewed in many forms but, the first thing that comes to the mind of a Filipino when heard this word is the old tradition of people helping a relocating family by setting enough volunteers to carry the house; and literally moving it to its new location. This practice is done by putting bamboo poles length-wise and cross-wise under the house forming a strong frame to lift the stilts from the ground and carrying the whole house with the men (often 20 or more) positioned at the ends of each pole. They do it in a festive mood. When the relocation is done, the moving family hosts a simple fiesta as an expression of gratitude towards their neighbors. Bayanihan is cooperation. What is the selection's connection to:Me? My Community? The World?​</a>

There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. There is coolness, calmness, when the sun does set. 3.) Man is a social being. Every day, she/he interacts with others in the community. He/She meets different people in varied situations and necessities to survive. Just like students go to school and learn from their teachers. Parents go to the office and work with their officemates. Drivers pick up passengers. Vendors sell their merchandise to various customers. An individual encounters different people day in and day out. Thus, a person should learn how to mingle with others in positive ways so that people would establish healthy relationships among themselves.​</h2><br />

                            9. Family Cook By Alma Anonas-Carpio All Soul’s Day means the family will be over to partake of the family feast of favorites. Lolo Cholo’s caldereta, Lola Ninay’s Sinigang na Ulo sa Miso. Tito Pascualito’s Beef Tapa con Ampalaya will make its first appearance at the table this year, beside the box of Krispy Kreme chocolate donuts young Paquito used to scarf down when his chemo permitted. Saling set a furious pace for herself. She had kare-kare from scratch to prepare for the clan and she had but a few more hours to get it done as she’d always gotten it done: Perfect, hot, served with spicy shrimp paste she’d sauteed from scratch with bird’s eye chilies from the backyard. There’s the leche flan to chill yet, she thinks as her cook’s knife decimates the banana hearts on the chopping board. Her hands fly over the talyasi in the yard sitting on its roaring wood fire, testing the heat before she begins the process of making the perfect oxtail in peanut sauce stew. The family will want this dish as she makes it each year: The meat fork-tender, the sauce rich and sinful. After all, this is the one time in the year she gets to make it for everyone. Decades of love in a huge wok, the simmering heart of her, this is the best expression of love Saling knows—and she never fails to express it with piquancy, with heat, with all her heart and soul poured into every morsel and drip of sauce. Saling pops the flans in the ref and moves on to the sink to wash up. It just wouldn’t do to leave the care of her precious cookware to the kids. Might as well do this while the stew simmers. Somewhere in the yard, a time-addled rooster crows at the witching hour. Saling turns her face up to the ebbing moonlight filtering into the outdoor kitchen. She closes her eyes as she calls the names of every clan member over the slow-bubbling kare-kare, dropping the okra and pechay in carefully, giving the lot a final firm stir before setting the lid on the huge wok. Saling takes a few minutes to look at each window of the old house where she’d spent the happiest moments and some of the most difficult days of her life. Breaking her reverie, she ladles the stew into large clay pots and sets them and the little sauce-bowls of sauteed shrimp-fry out on the buffet table set up in the ancestral home’s sala (the family always set that up ahead of time, of course), her smile tired, but so very satisfied. 1. Who is Saling? How did the author describe her in the story? 2. How does the author describe the setting of the story? 3. What Filipino tradition is described in the selection? 4. Based on the selection, how does Filipino family celebrate All Souls Day? 5.

                            28. Activity No. 2: Read the selection and fill in the table with the similarities and differences of "Ibalon" and "Overseas Filipino Workers as Everyday Heroes" by searching for appropriate resources to be able to have additional information. Be sure to provide and cite your sources. Use another paper as your answer sheet. Overseas Filipino Workers as Everyday Heroes 1 Overseas Filipino Workers take a huge risk when they travel and work abroad. OFWs sacrifice a lot in order to give a better life for their families. They are heroes in their own right because they live to help their families and sometimes even other people they do not even know, but are in need of their help and support. 2 Heroes think of other people first before they think of themselves. Heroes are unique individuals that sacrifice themselves for the sake of others. OFWs face great challenges head on with only their faith, hope, and determination to carry them through. They strive hard to ensure that their children's future would be bright and that they would live a life that they have dreamed of. 3 What are OFWs made of? They are made of determination, courage, a risk-taking attitude, a heart of gold, and other qualities that make them everyday heroes to a lot of people. They go beyond their call of duty to help their families, to help their country and sometimes people in need, even if it means putting themselves in danger. 4 You do not have to be an OFW to be a hero. You are a hero if you sacrifice a part of yourself to help other people who are in need. You are a hero if you can make someone else smile despite the trials and challenges he has. You are a hero if you can make others feel better about themselves. If you do any of these, then you are a hero in a person's heart.  Theme   ibalon  OFW as Everyday HeroesSetting  ​</h2><br />

                            30. ACTIVITY 2. Read and analyze the text below. Write its connection to your personal experiences, to your community, or to the world by completing the table below. Bayanihan is a Filipino term referring to the spirit of communal unity and cooperation. It was derived from the word bayan which means nation or community. It became a known trait of the Filipinos and was practiced by Filipinos until now. Bayanihan can be viewed in many forms but, the first thing that comes to the mind of a Filipino when heard this word is the old tradition of people helping a relocating family by setting enough volunteers to carry the house; and literally moving it to its new location. This practice is done by putting bamboo poles length-wise and cross-wise under the house forming a strong frame to lift the stilts from the ground and carrying the whole house with the men (often 20 or more) positioned at the ends of each pole. They do it in a festive mood. When the relocation is done, the moving family hosts a simple fiesta as an expression of gratitude towards their neighbors. Bayanihan is cooperation.
