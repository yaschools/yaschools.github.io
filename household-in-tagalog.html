                                            pls translate to Tagalog/Filipino.It's great that the economy is growing and rebounding back from the hit it took from the COVID-19 pandemic. It's not there yet, but I'm optimistic about the situation.The government's plan to keep up the rise and recover by acceleration of the vaccineprogram is one I'm certainly looking forward to. If this pace continues, we're certainly recover.Further on, oil prices going to be still high or not is certainly another thing to watch out for, which the chief of the Natural Economic and Development authority said the country will be doing. They're saying they have it if it does go up, as I have no idea what they're talking about I'm going to trust them. Moving forward, Both industry and service sectors growing is positive, but agriculture growth being impeded and even pushed back by typhoons and the African swine fever is a shame. The rise in gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily driven by household consumption accounting for 5.2 percentage of overall GDP growth is great, I guess I'll have to buy more or something to help the economy.My reaction really isn't much of a reaction, but I certainly hope I'll understand most of these terms by the end of the school year.​</a>

ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project will provide food for 55.000 low-income families, informal settlers, and families who have lost their livelihoods due to the COVID-19 pandemic. An initial 55,000 poor households affected by COVID-19 will receive a bag of rice, and canned goods from ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project. ADB has launched an emergency food provision program on 31 March, following the approval of the $5 million Rapid Emergency Supplies Provision technical assistance program. The grant is implemented under the Tagalog name Bayan Bayanihan, the well-known Filipino principle of sharing what one has with one's community.The program provides for essential food supplies to around 55,000 of the most vulnerable households in the National Capital Region and neighboring areas, affected by income losses for daily wage earners due to the enhanced quarantine to contain COVID-19. It will act as a 'bridge' support until ADB's large-scale cash transfer program is rolled out. The program has a collaboration platform to attract private sector and philanthropic contributions for its expansion.1. What is the newsflash about?2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Why not. Everyone should learn to take care of themselves and their home regardless of the gender. This statement is true if you are asked as opposed to boys but it is not exactly the point. Everyone can be good in doing household chores.</p><p>2. Why not. We don't have to be skinny to become fashion models. We don't need to be skinny but toned and proportioned. Always remember that there are plus sized women who works as professional models. Beauty comes from all sizes, you are beautiful in your own way.</p><p>3. Why not. Brando needs to be respected. Although he is too young to be a boss, in a workplace there should be always have unity. They cannot achieve unity if they will not obey each other.</p><p>4. Why not. This means that only those who are from Luzon are fluent speaking in Tagalog. This type of stereotyping needs to be stopped. It can create chaos between two or more areas. For sure there are many people who came from visayas that are also fluent in speaking Tagalog.</p><p>5. Why not. Not all students of UP are genius. There are also average students that studies in UP.

It's not there yet, but I'm optimistic about the situation.The government's plan to keep up the rise and recover by acceleration of the vaccineprogram is one I'm certainly looking forward to. If this pace continues, we're certainly recover.Further on, oil prices going to be still high or not is certainly another thing to watch out for, which the chief of the Natural Economic and Development authority said the country will be doing. They're saying they have it if it does go up, as I have no idea what they're talking about I'm going to trust them. Moving forward, Both industry and service sectors growing is positive, but agriculture growth being impeded and even pushed back by typhoons and the African swine fever is a shame. The rise in gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily driven by household consumption accounting for 5.2 percentage of overall GDP growth is great, I guess I'll have to buy more or something to help the economy.My reaction really isn't much of a reaction, but I certainly hope I'll understand most of these terms by the end of the school year.​</h2><br />

Sinasabi nila na mayroon sila kung ito ay tumaas, dahil wala akong ideya kung ano ang kanilang pinag-uusapan tungkol sa pagtitiwalaan ko sila. Sa pasulong, parehong positibo ang paglago ng industriya at mga sektor ng serbisyo, ngunit ang paglago ng agrikultura ay nahahadlangan at itinutulak pa ng mga bagyo at African swine fever ay isang kahihiyan. Ang pagtaas sa gross domestic product (GDP) ay pangunahing hinihimok ng pagkonsumo ng sambahayan na nagkakahalaga ng 5.2 porsyento ng kabuuang paglago ng GDP, sa palagay ko kailangan kong bumili ng higit pa o isang bagay upang makatulong sa ekonomiya.</p><p></p><p>Ang aking reaksyon ay talagang hindi gaanong reaksyon, ngunit tiyak na inaasahan kong mauunawaan ko ang karamihan sa mga terminong ito sa pagtatapos ng taon ng pag-aaral.</p><br />

It will act as a 'bridge' support until ADB's large-scale cash transfer program is rolled out.
