                                            Why The Sky is High (Tagalog myth)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on Earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was, therefore, his father's right hand man.  He was always helping with the work in the field, and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily.  In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility.  He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the cooking.  He also pounded the palay that his father and Ingat harvested.  Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name.  Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground.  Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual.   He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.   His anger added to his strength and desire to finish the work quickly.  So he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised.  In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.  When he finished pounding rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen, and that is why it is where it is today.1.	Who are the brothers?2.	Who was careful in everything he did?3.

                                            So, what do you notice with each pair in every item? If you say that they show relationships, then you are correct The term that means "word relationships" is called Analogy. It is like a word puzzle. It always contains two pairs of words. It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</a>

When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</a>

                                            inequality in one variable. History of Carmona In the late 16th century, a Spanish colonial resettlement program was implemented across wide areas of what came to be known as the province of (EXAMPLE) CAVITE. The program was designed to integrate the Filipinos into the religious and political institutions of the Spaniards. (1)__________ was first established as a mission town in 1595. Together with the other mission towns in the province, it became one of the centers of religious and economic activities in the first centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Carmona used to be a barrio of the Mission Town of Silang. It was locally known as "(2)_____________ "", a tagalog word for plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. At that time, this barrio was just a small farming community with a very small population. As its population rapidly increased, religious and political separation from the town of Silang was later sought from Spain. Eventually, it became an independent municipality on February 20, 1857 by virtue of the Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de (5)__________ The name (3_______) was adopted as a sign of gratitude to the Spanish officials who influenced the Central Government at the time of separation of the barrio. With boundaries properly delineated and a church established, it started its own religious and political administration. The people of Carmona have actively participated in the revolution against the Spaniards. It also witnessed the Filipinos' resistance against the Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation, some of Carmona's prominent houses were used as Japanese headquarters while the hills became the stronghold of Filipino revolutionaries After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions or land conflicts.​</a>

One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the 
woman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them.

Why The Sky is High (Tagalog myth)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on Earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was, therefore, his father's right hand man.  He was always helping with the work in the field, and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily.  In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility.  He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the cooking.  He also pounded the palay that his father and Ingat harvested.  Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name.  Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground.  Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual.   He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.   His anger added to his strength and desire to finish the work quickly.  So he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised.  In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.  When he finished pounding rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen, and that is why it is where it is today.1.	Who are the brothers?2.	Who was careful in everything he did?3.

                            3. So, what do you notice with each pair in every item? If you say that they show relationships, then you are correct The term that means "word relationships" is called Analogy. It is like a word puzzle. It always contains two pairs of words. It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</h2><br />

When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher.

Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God.

A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded.

During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands.

During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "<strong>(4) __SORTEO____</strong>". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on land ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions on land conflicts.</p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>YAN NA LODI KAKATAPOS KO LANG RIN MAGSAGOT NIYAN NASA HISTORY OF CARMONA LANG YAN BASAHIN MO PARA ALAM MO KUNG SAAN KINUHA YUNG SAGOT KO U.U TNX ME LATER AT PABRAINLEST NA RIN PO BYE  MWUAH &lt;3</strong></p><br />

                            10. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the 
woman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation.
