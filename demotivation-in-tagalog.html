                            28. What is Adam's Equity Theory of Motivation? Equity Theory, otherwise known as the Equity Theory of Motivation, was introduced in 1963 by John Stacey Adams, a workplace behavioral psychologist. It is based on a simple idea. A succesful workplace can enhance team motivation by treating everyone with respect and dignity. According to Adam's Equity Theory of motivation, employees who identify a situation of inequality between them and their peers will feel demotivated and distressed​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The Equity Theory suggests that individuals will compare their own treatment and rewards to those of their peers and will strive to achieve equity in the workplace. If they perceive that they are being treated unfairly or receiving fewer rewards than their peers, they will experience negative emotions such as resentment, frustration, and demotivation. On the other hand, if they perceive that they are being treated fairly and receiving appropriate rewards for their work, they will experience positive emotions such as satisfaction and motivation.<p></p>The theory proposes that individuals have an inherent need for fairness and will strive to maintain equity in their relationships with others. This means that they will attempt to balance their own contributions and rewards with those of their peers. For example, if an individual feels that they are putting in more effort or achieving better results than their peers, but are not receiving the same level of recognition or rewards, they may become demotivated and unhappy. On the other hand, if they feel that they are being treated fairly and receiving appropriate rewards for their efforts, they will be more likely to remain motivated and engaged in their work.<p></p>Overall, Adam's Equity Theory of Motivation emphasizes the importance of fairness and equity in the workplace and suggests that individuals are more likely to be motivated when they feel that they are being treated fairly and receiving appropriate rewards for their efforts. By treating all employees with respect and fairness, organizations can create a positive and motivating work environment.<br />
