                                            1. “Mother tongue education refers to any form of schooling that makes use of the language or languages that children are most familiar with. This is usually the language that children speak at home with their family. The ‘mother tongue’ does not have to be the language spoken by the mother. Children can and often do speak more than one or even two languages at home.”
2. “Another way to grasp the concept of animatism is to differentiate the Cebuano terms gahum and kusog. Gahum comes closer to the Tagalog galing, acquired power or skill as in the case of politics, while kusog comes closer to the Tagalog lakas, an almost innate power with connotations of dynamism and energy.”

                                            What is Itq &amp;particularFolk songs in general have the following characteristicsA. The lyrics are according to the native tongue.Because songs are based on the daily experiences of the peoplein aplace and the message of the songs needs to be understood easily to be appreciated,the lyrics of the songs are written or sung in their own dialects. For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirPamulinawen). The Kapampangan's Atin Cu Pung Singsing, and the Bicolano'sown dialects. Why do you think it is important for a folk song to be sung or writtenin their native tongue?B. Passed down through oral tradition to family or community members, hence,learned by mere memorizationSinging is a form of social bonding among early Filipino families. Because theydid not have access to internet, T.V. and radio during that time, singing folksongsbecame their favorite pastime.C. Unknown composers and lyricistsMost composers of Filipino folk songs are unknown because songs are justbased on daily experiences and are passed down orally.D. Simple key signature of the songDo you know how to play a guitar? If you can play this instrument, you cantry to play a simple folk song. While playing, you will notice that it starts with aparticular key (key of G for example) and ends in that same key. That only shows thesimplicity of the Luzon folk songs.E. Duple, triple, or, quadruple are common meters usedThese meters were very common during that time. The dances and commonsongs are based on these meters. The composers of the folk songs adopted theserhythmic patterns to their compositions.What folk songs do you know? Can you identify the meters used based on thediscussion in the review section of this module?F. Primarily based on the community's culture, tradition and livelihood​</a>

For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog. (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andPamulinawen). The Kapampangan's Atin Cu Pung Singsing, and the Bicolano'sSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirown dialects. Why do you think it is important for a folk song to be sung or writtenin their native tongue?​</a>

                            11. 1. “Mother tongue education refers to any form of schooling that makes use of the language or languages that children are most familiar with. This is usually the language that children speak at home with their family. The ‘mother tongue’ does not have to be the language spoken by the mother. Children can and often do speak more than one or even two languages at home.”
2. “Another way to grasp the concept of animatism is to differentiate the Cebuano terms gahum and kusog. Gahum comes closer to the Tagalog galing, acquired power or skill as in the case of politics, while kusog comes closer to the Tagalog lakas, an almost innate power with connotations of dynamism and energy.”
What are the techniques of defining that you have identified from the two concepts that were defined?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Why not. Everyone should learn to take care of themselves and their home regardless of the gender. This statement is true if you are asked as opposed to boys but it is not exactly the point. Everyone can be good in doing household chores.</p><p>2. Why not. We don't have to be skinny to become fashion models. We don't need to be skinny but toned and proportioned. Always remember that there are plus sized women who works as professional models. Beauty comes from all sizes, you are beautiful in your own way.</p><p>3. Why not. Brando needs to be respected. Although he is too young to be a boss, in a workplace there should be always have unity. They cannot achieve unity if they will not obey each other.</p><p>4. Why not. This means that only those who are from Luzon are fluent speaking in Tagalog. This type of stereotyping needs to be stopped. It can create chaos between two or more areas. For sure there are many people who came from visayas that are also fluent in speaking Tagalog.</p><p>5. Why not. Not all students of UP are genius. There are also average students that studies in UP. You can study in UP not because you are genius but because of your attitude and strategies on how to become successful in the future.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa brainliest na yan char lang. sana makatulong</p><br />

                            25. What is Itq &amp;particularFolk songs in general have the following characteristicsA. The lyrics are according to the native tongue.Because songs are based on the daily experiences of the peoplein aplace and the message of the songs needs to be understood easily to be appreciated,the lyrics of the songs are written or sung in their own dialects. For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirPamulinawen). The Kapampangan's Atin Cu Pung Singsing, and the Bicolano'sown dialects. Why do you think it is important for a folk song to be sung or writtenin their native tongue?B. Passed down through oral tradition to family or community members, hence,learned by mere memorizationSinging is a form of social bonding among early Filipino families. Because theydid not have access to internet, T.V. and radio during that time, singing folksongsbecame their favorite pastime.C. Unknown composers and lyricistsMost composers of Filipino folk songs are unknown because songs are justbased on daily experiences and are passed down orally.D. Simple key signature of the songDo you know how to play a guitar? If you can play this instrument, you cantry to play a simple folk song. While playing, you will notice that it starts with aparticular key (key of G for example) and ends in that same key. That only shows thesimplicity of the Luzon folk songs.E. Duple, triple, or, quadruple are common meters usedThese meters were very common during that time. The dances and commonsongs are based on these meters. The composers of the folk songs adopted theserhythmic patterns to their compositions.What folk songs do you know? Can you identify the meters used based on thediscussion in the review section of this module?F. Primarily based on the community's culture, tradition and livelihood​</h2><br />
