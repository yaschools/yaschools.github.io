Indeed, how heartbreaking and devasting to only hear from the word "unemployment". But what more could it be when we learn further about it? What does "unemployment" really mean? Is it just the lack of one's source of living? Or is there more to it than just that? What are the news and articles pertaining to it trying to address? What are they trying to imply? What happens to those affected by this certain issue? The people, their families, status, lifestyle, their country? And oh, the economy. A lot of questions linger in our minds, leaving us a mark on what "unemployment" really is, and how far it can go and affect us. These questions, they add up and increase; yet, they remain unanswered. Thus, the making of this essay has a major goal of fulfilling the thoughts, untiringly lingering in our minds about the true essence of "unemployment", its aspects, effects, how to cope with it, and more.​</a>

                                            Question(true or false)1. Human conduct should always be governed by the ideas of what is good and what is just.2. The moral good is concerned with the rightness of human action.3. An act can be judged as right or wrong based solely on the nature of the act itself.4. Modern thought teaches us that there is a God and a divine plan.5. The sense of the good serves as a moral power in each person to actualize a world that is just.6. For Aristotle and the Stoics, the concept of human dignity was associated with freedom and human abilities.7. Respecting the human person means respecting his or her ways of living, religious norms, traditions and the values he or she professes.​</a>

But virtually all Christian theologians regard such a view, however common it may be in the popular culture, as overly simplistic and unsophisticated; the biblical perspective, as they see it, is far more subtly nuanced than that.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest</p><br />

What happens to those affected by this certain issue? The people, their families, status, lifestyle, their country? And oh, the economy. A lot of questions linger in our minds, leaving us a mark on what "unemployment" really is, and how far it can go and affect us. These questions, they add up and increase; yet, they remain unanswered.

What it means to Live by the Golden Rule.The Golden rules says “Do unto others what you would have them do unto you” or Treat others like you want to be treated”Answer the following:1. How difficult would it be to follow the Golden rule all the time?2. Does living by the Golden rule affect your thoughts or just your actions?3. What would life be like if people follow the Golden Rule a. at home? b. At school?c. In the community? d. In the world?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Living the Golden Rule can be difficult at times, as it requires us to put the needs of others before our own and to be mindful of how our actions and words affect the people around us. It is not necessarily an easy task, as it requires individuals to consider the consequences of their actions on others before they proceed. It also requires a great deal of self-control and compassion for others.Living by the Golden Rule does not just affect one's actions, but also their thoughts. When considering how to treat others, one must think kindly and with respect.It would be a more harmonious environment. Families would show more respect, kindness, and consideration for one another. People would be more likely to consider the feelings, needs, and opinions of those around them and treat them with the same level of respect and care they would like to receive. This could lead to less conflict and a deeper sense of connection between relatives.<br />
