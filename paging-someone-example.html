                                            LET’S READ &amp; LEARN
When you were in Grade 1, you learned about
nutritious and less nutritious food.
Nutritious food contains vitamins, minerals, proteins,
carbohydrates and other nutrients needed by the
body to be strong, energized and less prone to
sickness. Less nutritious food has too much sugar,
salt and fats. When you eat less nutritious food
more than nutritious food, your body will not get the
nutrients it needs to achieve good health.
The picture above has examples of nutritious food: squash, cabbage, pechay, mangoes, carrots,
fortified milk, chocomalt milk drink, whole grain cereal, brown rice, chicken, eggs, and fish.
Look at the pictures you drew on the previous page. Which ones are nutritious? Which ones are
less nutritious?
Nutrition is the study of food and how the body uses
it to maintain health and prevent sickness.
Malnutrition is a condition where the body does
not receive the right amount of nutrients it needs
to be healthy. When people think of malnutrition,
they usually think of someone who is weak and
underweight, but even those who are overweight can
have malnutrition.
Children who do not eat enough nutritious food may
develop undernutrition. We need to make sure that
we eat enough nutritious food everyday to avoid this
form of malnutrition.
Children who eat too much may develop
overnutrition. Overnutrition increases the chances of
getting serious health problems, like heart diseases,
stroke, diabetes and even cancer.
A person who is malnourished:
• may not have a strong, healthy body and may
struggle to move or carry heavy things.
• is also more likely to get sick. If a person gets sick
often, it could mean that they lack the vitamins
and minerals that their body needs.
• often lacks energy. When a person lacks energy,
they get tired easily when playing with friends or
may get sleepy in class.</a>

                                            Being a celebrity is often difficult. First of all, celebrities have to look almost perfect all the time. There's always a photographer ready to take an unflattering picture of a famous person looking dumpy in old clothes. Celebrities also sacrifice their private lives. Their personal struggles, divorces, or family tragedies all end up as front-page news. Last, and most frightening of all, celebrities are in constant danger of the wrong kind of attention. Threatening letters and even physical attacks from crazy fans are things a celebrity must contend with. Topic/Point: Supporting detail: 1. Supporting detail: 2. Supporting detail: 3. People lie for different reasons. One common reason is to avoid hurting someone's feelings. For example, a friend might ask,-" Do you like my new haircut?"-If you think it's ugly, you might still answer, -"Yes." Another common reason for lying is to avoid a fight. Say a friend angers you and then asks, "Are you upset with me?" You might answer, -"No", to avoid an argument. People also lie so that they 'll fit in, as when you listen to a boring person and politely say, "That's Interesting." In addition, people lie to avoid spending more time with someone. For instance, you might lie, -" I have to go now." - Topic/Point: Supporting detail: 1. Supporting detail: 2. Supporting detail: 3.​</a>

nutritious and less nutritious food.
Nutritious food contains vitamins, minerals, proteins,
carbohydrates and other nutrients needed by the
body to be strong, energized and less prone to
sickness. Less nutritious food has too much sugar,
salt and fats. When you eat less nutritious food
more than nutritious food, your body will not get the
nutrients it needs to achieve good health.
The picture above has examples of nutritious food: squash, cabbage, pechay, mangoes, carrots,
fortified milk, chocomalt milk drink, whole grain cereal, brown rice, chicken, eggs, and fish.
Look at the pictures you drew on the previous page. Which ones are nutritious? Which ones are
less nutritious?
Nutrition is the study of food and how the body uses
it to maintain health and prevent sickness.
Malnutrition is a condition where the body does
not receive the right amount of nutrients it needs
to be healthy. When people think of malnutrition,
they usually think of someone who is weak and
underweight, but even those who are overweight can
have malnutrition.
Children who do not eat enough nutritious food may
develop undernutrition. We need to make sure that
we eat enough nutritious food everyday to avoid this
form of malnutrition.
Children who eat too much may develop
overnutrition. Overnutrition increases the chances of
getting serious health problems, like heart diseases,
stroke, diabetes and even cancer.
A person who is malnourished:
• may not have a strong, healthy body and may
struggle to move or carry heavy things.
• is also more likely to get sick. If a person gets sick
often, it could mean that they lack the vitamins
and minerals that their body needs.
• often lacks energy. When a person lacks energy,
they get tired easily when playing with friends or
may get sleepy in class.</h2><br />

                            27. Being a celebrity is often difficult. First of all, celebrities have to look almost perfect all the time. There's always a photographer ready to take an unflattering picture of a famous person looking dumpy in old clothes. Celebrities also sacrifice their private lives. Their personal struggles, divorces, or family tragedies all end up as front-page news. Last, and most frightening of all, celebrities are in constant danger of the wrong kind of attention. Threatening letters and even physical attacks from crazy fans are things a celebrity must contend with. Topic/Point: Supporting detail: 1. Supporting detail: 2. Supporting detail: 3. People lie for different reasons. One common reason is to avoid hurting someone's feelings. For example, a friend might ask,-" Do you like my new haircut?"-If you think it's ugly, you might still answer, -"Yes." Another common reason for lying is to avoid a fight. Say a friend angers you and then asks, "Are you upset with me?" You might answer, -"No", to avoid an argument. People also lie so that they 'll fit in, as when you listen to a boring person and politely say, "That's Interesting." In addition, people lie to avoid spending more time with someone. For instance, you might lie, -" I have to go now." - Topic/Point: Supporting detail: 1. Supporting detail: 2. Supporting detail: 3.​</h2><br />
