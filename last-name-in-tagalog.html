                            14. Why the Sky is High? (Tagalog)In the early days,when the sky was still low,two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father's right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility. He fetched water,cleaned the house, and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the play that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had pound a greater quantity of palsy than usual. He was irritated because everyone he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would raise. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.
