                                            - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

                                            What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</a>

One of America’s gifts to us is efficiency, the scientific coordination of planning and action, the philosophy of correct and timely execution. Though long schooled in our Oriental disrespect for Time and encouraged, though unwittingly, to expect the Will that causes the palay to grow to also do our work for us, we realize at last that Time is an element to reckon with, that life here and now, being spread thinly over a limited period of years, must be economized and put to some profitable use. 
Our special significance is this realization in the economic life of our people. The bureaucratic system has impressed upon most of us that we must observe punctuality or lose out; that out pay envelop comes to many of us during stated periods of the month and not before or after, although we may spend its content in advance; and that our efficiency of times detrmine our income.</a>

                                            - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

                                            Learning Task 3: Case Study
In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other
people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be
people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or another ethnicity. If you know someone
who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects. Since you are
not allowed to go out at present because of the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, look for someone who is
near to your place or whom you have contact with through social media.
Be guided with the following questions as you write your case study:
1. Describe the group of people that you chose. Who are they? What do they do? Where did they
come from? What do you know about them?
2. Discuss their way of life in terms of: a. Social organizations b. Language c. Religion d. Arts and
literature e. Economic systems f. Values, beliefs and traditions
3. Summarize what you have learned using the 3-2-1 chart below:

I did not like the work, the heat, or the tough boss, and for the first couple of weeks, my attitude reflected my unhappiness. The job wouldn’t change, I realized, but my way of thinking could. I decided to work as if the Lord was my boss, and that choice made all the difference. Explanation in tagalog</a>

                            4. - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

Our countrymen in hopes to improve the country believed the lies that the Spaniards told us--education, civilization, and religion, things we need to "flourish" as a country, so they say, not knowing that in exchange of all these is our own freedom. The things that they gave us, we already have in our own, beautiful way, but we ended up giving up our freedom to face their swords, and behind every sword is a cross. </p><p><strong>----------</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/2269963</strong></p><p></p><br />

As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</h2><br />

One of America’s gifts to us is efficiency, the scientific coordination of planning and action, the philosophy of correct and timely execution. Though long schooled in our Oriental disrespect for Time and encouraged, though unwittingly, to expect the Will that causes the palay to grow to also do our work for us, we realize at last that Time is an element to reckon with, that life here and now, being spread thinly over a limited period of years, must be economized and put to some profitable use. 
Our special significance is this realization in the economic life of our people. The bureaucratic system has impressed upon most of us that we must observe punctuality or lose out; that out pay envelop comes to many of us during stated periods of the month and not before or after, although we may spend its content in advance; and that our efficiency of times detrmine our income.</h2><br />

To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

                            18. Learning Task 3: Case Study
In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other
people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be
people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or another ethnicity. If you know someone
who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects. Since you are
not allowed to go out at present because of the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, look for someone who is
near to your place or whom you have contact with through social media.
Be guided with the following questions as you write your case study:
1. Describe the group of people that you chose. Who are they? What do they do? Where did they
come from? What do you know about them?
2. Discuss their way of life in terms of: a. Social organizations b. Language c. Religion d. Arts and
literature e. Economic systems f. Values, beliefs and traditions
3. Summarize what you have learned using the 3-2-1 chart below:

                            19. To help with my college expenses, I spent summers working in a textile mill. My assignment was in the bleachery, the hottest part of the complex. I did not like the work, the heat, or the tough boss, and for the first couple of weeks, my attitude reflected my unhappiness. The job wouldn’t change, I realized, but my way of thinking could. I decided to work as if the Lord was my boss, and that choice made all the difference. Explanation in tagalog</h2><br />
