Write the word CULTURE, HISTORY, ENVIRONMENT or ECONOMY on your answer sheet. 46." When I was a boy, one of the rules at home that II did not like at all was to be made to lie on the bare floor of our sala after lunch. I usually lay side by side with two other children in the family. We were forced to sleep by my mother. She watched us as she darned old dresses, read an awit, or hummed a cradle song in Tagalog." (from "Siesta", Leopoldo R. Serrano) 47. "The custom of having a siesta was introduced in our country by the Spaniards. Indeed, during the Spanish times, the Philippines was the land of the fiesta, the novena, and the siesta." (Siesta, Leopoldo R. Serrano) 48. "He looked about for a house he could go to and lose his bad feeling. He almost jumped up in delight. He had reached the edge of the barrio and so must be near the house of Mang Tinoy and Aling Nadang. Mang Tinoy was a forester. He took care of the big forest back of Lian. He and Aling Nadang had many children and a cozy, nipa house with big family rooms." (from " A Family for Tomas" by Loreto Paras-Sulit) 49. "Tomas had often spent the night with them when he went to the forest to gather firewood to sell in order to earn a peso or more for himself."

Like they said though:
You can take a man out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the man
Mga kababayan, turn up!
Tayo ay Pilipino
Kahit anong kulay ng balat
Isasapuso
Mapa-Tagalog, Bisaya, o Ilokano
Walang tatalo sa bagsik
Ng ating dugo
Isigaw ng malakas ang
Ating panalo
Wag nang pagusapan
Ang mga negatibong pangyayari

Kinabukasan na natin 'to
Panalo!
Yeah
Keep runnin' ya mouth when you lyin'
I stay on my business while watchin' you dyin'
I'm takin' my people to heights while you cryin'
Bout regular livin' &amp; that's what I'm tryna
Prove, 'stead of just lyin' in booths
First true Filipino rapper on the news
Sit, enjoy it if ya' cool
Haters can snooze
While I put my city on the map
22-double the Olongapo City no cap
Never forgettin' the street where my
Cousin would sit when we always just listen to rap
Kendrick, Em, &amp; A$AP with some metal
And man we would turn up with that
Been mundane till the sun came
Now I want fame like a kid in the trap uh
Aye
I been in Spain (Spain)
But the letter 'S' is silent (pain)
I'm claimin' my reign like a king
So I can water crops for survivin' (rain rain)
Go away if you trippin' (yuh)
Had a homie he was Cripn' (cuh)
Ain't got no love for the people
Who talk over songs when they
Claimin' they listen (listen listen)
These bars - never done, uh
3 stars and a sun, aye
Blue, red draped down on a flag
No we never fear none
Most of us didn't grow up with a trust fund
Know that I'm willin' to kill for a loved one
I'm on the move from a nothin' to someone
Reminding my people to shout:
Tayo ay Pilipino

I believe it is possible if the government themselves make the first move because with enough power and charisma a single person
can move an opinion of a single country, this has been proven true through events like the French and Russian revolution.
As long as the people are given a reason to look up to and respect this decision then achieving equality is far from impossible.</a>

                                            Why The Sky is High (Tagalog myth)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on Earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was, therefore, his father's right hand man.  He was always helping with the work in the field, and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily.  In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility.  He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the cooking.  He also pounded the palay that his father and Ingat harvested.  Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name.  Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground.  Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual.   He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.   His anger added to his strength and desire to finish the work quickly.  So he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised.  In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.  When he finished pounding rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen, and that is why it is where it is today.1.	Who are the brothers?2.	Who was careful in everything he did?3.	How did Daskol do his work?4.	Did Daskol like the work of pounding rice? Yes or no?5.	Why did Daskol become irritated while pounding rice one day? Choose the letter only.a.

Personal development is closely linked to
self-awareness. It gives you the opportunity
to take an honest look at the areas of your
life that need improvement. Through this
process, you get to know who you really
are, what your true values are, and where
you would like to go in life. It is very important in order for us students
not to regret our decisions in life. We
should think thoroughly because we may
never know what will happen in the future.
Be mature enough and grow up to think
what you should want to be in the future.</a>

                                            So, what do you notice with each pair in every item? If you say that they show relationships, then you are correct The term that means "word relationships" is called Analogy. It is like a word puzzle. It always contains two pairs of words. It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</a>

                                            Our Mother Tongue (Written by: Jose P. Rizal) If truly a people dearly love The tongue to them by Heaven sent, They'll surely yearn for liberty Like a bird above in the firmament. Because by its language one can judge A town, a barrio, and kingdom; And like any other created thing Every human being loves his freedom. One who doesn't love his native tongue, Is worse than putrid fish and beast; And like a truly precious thing It therefore deserves to be cherished. The Tagalog language's akin to Latin, To English, Spanish, angelical tongue; For God who knows how to look after us This language He bestowed us upon. As others, our language is the same With alphabet and letters of its own, It was lost because a storm did destroy On the lake the bangka 1 in years bygone. QUESTIONS: 3.

When I was a boy, one of the rules at home that II did not like at all was to be made to lie on the bare floor of our sala after lunch. I usually lay side by side with two other children in the family. We were forced to sleep by my mother. She watched us as she darned old dresses, read an awit, or hummed a cradle song in Tagalog." (from "Siesta", Leopoldo R. Serrano) 47. "The custom of having a siesta was introduced in our country by the Spaniards. Indeed, during the Spanish times, the Philippines was the land of the fiesta, the novena, and the siesta." (Siesta, Leopoldo R. Serrano) 48. "He looked about for a house he could go to and lose his bad feeling. He almost jumped up in delight. He had reached the edge of the barrio and so must be near the house of Mang Tinoy and Aling Nadang. Mang Tinoy was a forester. He took care of the big forest back of Lian. He and Aling Nadang had many children and a cozy, nipa house with big family rooms." (from " A Family for Tomas" by Loreto Paras-Sulit) 49.

Mga kababayan, turn up!

So I can water crops for survivin' (rain rain)
Go away if you trippin' (yuh)

Ain't got no love for the people
Who talk over songs when they
Claimin' they listen (listen listen)
These bars - never done, uh

Blue, red draped down on a flag
No we never fear none
Most of us didn't grow up with a trust fund
Know that I'm willin' to kill for a loved one
I'm on the move from a nothin' to someone
Reminding my people to shout:
Tayo ay Pilipino
Kahit anong kulay ng balat
Isasapuso
Mapa-Tagalog, Bisaya, o Ilokano
Walang tatalo sa bagsik
Ng ating dugo
Isigaw ng malakas ang
Ating panalo
Wag nang pagusapan
Ang mga negatibong pangyayari
San mang panig ka
Nasa mundo
Kinabukasan na natin to, (Lam mo na.)
(Woo!) Panalo!
Aye
Huh, aye
Kung inakala mong isang lenggwahe
Lang kayang gamitin ni Ez Mil
La kang mapapala kung ganyan ka
Magisip kay Bathala ka sisingil;
Utang na galing sa loob na
Lumutang, hinain sa turon na may
Pusang sinaing sa-
(Mag ilokano ka tol!)
Ano?
(Ilokano!, Ilokano)
Okay!

                            17. Why The Sky is High (Tagalog myth)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on Earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was, therefore, his father's right hand man.  He was always helping with the work in the field, and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily.  In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility.  He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the cooking.  He also pounded the palay that his father and Ingat harvested.  Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name.  Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground.  Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual.   He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.   His anger added to his strength and desire to finish the work quickly.  So he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised.  In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.  When he finished pounding rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen, and that is why it is where it is today.1.	Who are the brothers?2.	Who was careful in everything he did?3.	How did Daskol do his work?4.	Did Daskol like the work of pounding rice? Yes or no?5.	Why did Daskol become irritated while pounding rice one day? Choose the letter only.a.

Personal development is closely linked to
self-awareness. It gives you the opportunity
to take an honest look at the areas of your
life that need improvement. Through this
process, you get to know who you really
are, what your true values are, and where
you would like to go in life. It is very important in order for us students
not to regret our decisions in life. We
should think thoroughly because we may
never know what will happen in the future.
Be mature enough and grow up to think
what you should want to be in the future.</h2><br />

                            20. So, what do you notice with each pair in every item? If you say that they show relationships, then you are correct The term that means "word relationships" is called Analogy. It is like a word puzzle. It always contains two pairs of words. It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</h2><br />

                            23. Our Mother Tongue (Written by: Jose P. Rizal) If truly a people dearly love The tongue to them by Heaven sent, They'll surely yearn for liberty Like a bird above in the firmament. Because by its language one can judge A town, a barrio, and kingdom; And like any other created thing Every human being loves his freedom. One who doesn't love his native tongue, Is worse than putrid fish and beast; And like a truly precious thing It therefore deserves to be cherished. The Tagalog language's akin to Latin, To English, Spanish, angelical tongue; For God who knows how to look after us This language He bestowed us upon. As others, our language is the same With alphabet and letters of its own, It was lost because a storm did destroy On the lake the bangka 1 in years bygone. QUESTIONS: 3. What Literary Influence does the poem have? Explain why. need help huhu╥﹏╥╥﹏╥​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Jose Rizal's poem "<strong>Our Mother Tongue</strong>" makes use of various literary influences, including <strong>Romanticism and Nationalism</strong>. <strong>Romanticism</strong> is evident in the poem's emotional tone and imagery, as well as in its emphasis on individual experience and feeling. <strong>Nationalism</strong> is also a major influence in the poem, as Rizal seeks to promote a sense of national identity and pride among the Filipino people. Rizal also draws on the traditions of oral poetry and folklore in his use of repetition, rhythm, and metaphor, highlighting the potential of the Filipino language as a powerful tool for artistic expression and cultural resistance. His use of Romantic and Nationalist themes, along with his incorporation of traditional Filipino literary techniques, make the poem a powerful and evocative expression of Filipino identity and pride.</p><br />
