Hello, my name is Frances Gracy H. Beslig and today I will show you how to cook a air fryer pork adobo . First of all before I will show you how to cook a air fryer pork adobo, I will tell you the different kinds of organism that is found in our front yard: Ants or langgam in tagalog ,birds or ibon, snail or kuhol, and little frogs or maliliit na mga palaka. So moving on I will show you the ingredients we need.
So we need oil, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, pepper, pork, and soy sauce with onions and calamansi for dipping. After that we have to wash the utensils we need like plates. So the procedure is to: 
• Preheat the air fryer to 400°F. 
• In a large bowl, combine the oil, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. 
• Next, add the pork belly pieces to the oil mixture to coat each piece. 
• Then, in a single layer, place the pork belly cubes in the air fryer basket. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook them in batches. 
Cook the pork belly bites for 20 minutes, shaking and flipping them a couple of times throughout the air-frying time. You can always cook them longer if you want them crispier or more done. 
• Remove the bites from the air fryer and serve warm.</a>

                                            inequality in one variable. History of Carmona In the late 16th century, a Spanish colonial resettlement program was implemented across wide areas of what came to be known as the province of (EXAMPLE) CAVITE. The program was designed to integrate the Filipinos into the religious and political institutions of the Spaniards. (1)__________ was first established as a mission town in 1595. Together with the other mission towns in the province, it became one of the centers of religious and economic activities in the first centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Carmona used to be a barrio of the Mission Town of Silang. It was locally known as "(2)_____________ "", a tagalog word for plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. At that time, this barrio was just a small farming community with a very small population. As its population rapidly increased, religious and political separation from the town of Silang was later sought from Spain. Eventually, it became an independent municipality on February 20, 1857 by virtue of the Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de (5)__________ The name (3_______) was adopted as a sign of gratitude to the Spanish officials who influenced the Central Government at the time of separation of the barrio. With boundaries properly delineated and a church established, it started its own religious and political administration. The people of Carmona have actively participated in the revolution against the Spaniards. It also witnessed the Filipinos' resistance against the Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation, some of Carmona's prominent houses were used as Japanese headquarters while the hills became the stronghold of Filipino revolutionaries After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions or land conflicts.​</a>

                                            would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</a>

our topic or title or whatever is "The Effects of Fossil Fuel: Is it Harmful to the Environment?"</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Firstly, a defense title is a concise and clear statement that summarizes the main point or argument of your research project. It should be brief and to the point, and provide a clear indication of the purpose and scope of your work. In the case of your topic, "The Effects of Fossil Fuel: Is it Harmful to the Environment?", it seems that your research is focused on examining the environmental impact of the use of fossil fuels.</p><p></p><p>To start, you can break down your title into three key components:</p><p></p><p>The Effects of Fossil Fuel - This part of your title indicates the focus of your research, which is on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source that is extracted from the earth, and include coal, oil, and natural gas.</p><p></p><p>Is it Harmful - This part of your title introduces the central question of your research, which is whether the use of fossil fuels is harmful to the environment. This question can be further refined by identifying specific aspects of the environment that are impacted by the use of fossil fuels, such as air pollution, water pollution, and climate change.</p><p></p><p>To the Environment - This part of your title indicates the scope of your research, which is focused specifically on the environmental impact of fossil fuels. It is important to be clear and specific about the scope of your research in your defense title, as this will help your audience understand the focus of your work.</p><p></p><p>Based on these three key components, you can revise your defense title to make it more concise and clear. Here's an example of a revised defense title:</p><p></p><p>"The Environmental Impact of Fossil Fuels: Assessing the Harmful Effects on Air, Water, and Climate"</p><p></p><p>I hope this helps you to better understand how to craft a defense title for your research project. Good luck with your defense!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Hello, my name is Frances Gracy H. Beslig and today I will show you how to cook a air fryer pork adobo . First of all before I will show you how to cook a air fryer pork adobo, I will tell you the different kinds of organism that is found in our front yard: Ants or langgam in tagalog ,birds or ibon, snail or kuhol, and little frogs or maliliit na mga palaka. So moving on I will show you the ingredients we need.
So we need oil, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, pepper, pork, and soy sauce with onions and calamansi for dipping. After that we have to wash the utensils we need like plates. So the procedure is to: 
• Preheat the air fryer to 400°F. 
• In a large bowl, combine the oil, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. 
• Next, add the pork belly pieces to the oil mixture to coat each piece. 
• Then, in a single layer, place the pork belly cubes in the air fryer basket. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook them in batches. 
Cook the pork belly bites for 20 minutes, shaking and flipping them a couple of times throughout the air-frying time. You can always cook them longer if you want them crispier or more done. 
• Remove the bites from the air fryer and serve warm.</h2><br />

The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</h2><br />
