                            1. 2.Nationalism is identification with one's own nation. Filipinos have mixed identities, languages, beliefs, and culture, but are also mixed with the other countries’ culture, as a Filipino, how would you express your nationalism despite the influence of the other countries?​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Nationalism and Identity</strong><p>Nationalism does not only rely on what country you live in or what type of citizenship you hold in. It is also based on how you act your identity to be truly called citizen of a particular country.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here are some of the examples to express our Nationalism despite of the mixed influence:</p>By obeying the rules and regulations of the country you live inBy embracing the culture and internalizing the lessons we can get from the citizens of a particular placeBy respecting the people around you and not acting as the superiorBy equally treating everyone and believing in your self that you are a citizen of the country you are living.By expressing through your clothes, paraphernalia, accessories and actions the symbols of nationalityBy accepting in yourself the culture and norms of the placeRespect the Filipino FlagEqual rights for everyone no matter what race they belong<p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>They say that being a true Filipino does not only rely on the blood flowing in our body. It should show in our actions, words, and responsibilities. To showcase our nationality, respecting the nation itself should be the first step. By following the laws that the government imposes. Through this simple step, we are already respecting the nation, the people on higher positions, and even the citizens of the nation. If we know how to obey rules, then we can say we are responsible enough to showcase our nationalism.</p><p></p><p>If you want to know what is patriotism, you can go to this link: https://brainly.ph/question/2178615</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

Muslims read the Qur'an 6. Buddhists believed i mass.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) Ancient Filipinos were animistic. They believed that <strong>everything has a spirit, from rocks and trees to animals and humans to natural phenomena</strong>. These spirits are collectively known as anito, derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *qanitu and Proto-Austronesian *qaNiCu ("spirit of the dead").</p><p></p><p>2.)Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the Foundation Stone, the most sacred site in the Jewish faith, lies behind it.</p><p></p><p>3.)Pork, rabbit, and shellfish are<strong> considered “unclean” </strong>and thus banned by Adventists. However, some Adventists choose to eat certain “clean” meats, such as fish, poultry, and red meats other than pork, as well as other animal products like eggs and low-fat dairy ( 5 ).</p><p></p><p>4.)Yes but…</p><p></p><p>According to Canon Law all Catholics requesting the sacrament of marriage should be fully initiated (Baptized; 1st Communion; Confirmation) prior to the wedding. So if there is time, the unconfirmed person can join and RCIA program, get confirmed and then get married after Easter.</p><p></p><p>However, the pastor/marrying priest can waive the Confirmation piece if having the bride and/or the groom get confirmed causes a grave inconvenience.</p><p></p><p>Here in the Diocese of Raleigh we have three major military installations: Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune, and Marine Corp Air Station Cherry Point. Due to deployments and transfers couples may not have an opportunity to go through RCIA to get confirmed. So the priest can easily marry them as not being confirmed does not interfere with the conferral of the Sacrament of Marriage.</p><p></p><p>In the end it is at the discretion of the priest performing the marriage. And, all of the priests I know are very flexible and willing to marry an unconfirmed person because I and they are just happy to see the couple getting married in the church.</p><p></p><p>5.) The 114 chapters, or Surahs, of the Qur'an are divided into 30 parts, which makes it possible for a Muslim to complete a reading of the whole Qur'an in a month. They often recite one part each day, especially during the month <strong>of Ramadan</strong> . Many Muslims learn parts of the Qur'an by heart.</p><p></p><p>6.)Buddhism is one of the world's largest religions and originated 2,500 years ago in India. Buddhists believe that <strong>the human life is one of suffering</strong>, and that meditation, spiritual and physical labor, and good behavior are the ways to achieve enlightenment, or nirvana.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>have a nc day^^</p><p></p><br />
