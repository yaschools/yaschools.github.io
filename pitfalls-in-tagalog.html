                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Boiled, poached, scrambled – no matter how you eat your eggs, you're getting a good dose of high-quality protein and vitamins A, D and B-12. If you're healthy, there's really no disadvantage to eating eggs every day. People with heart disease and diabetes may need to cut back, though, according to their doctors' advice. And anyone who wants to eat eggs daily should use a healthy, low-fat cooking method and ditch the unhealthy foods often served on the side.</p><br />

                            4. What are the benefits and possible pitfalls of having an official curriculum prescribed to all schools?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Well, the previous answers leave me unsatisfied, so here goes. I am particularly disappointed at those who say it could never happen—other nations do it.</p><p></p><p>First, the pros and cons change as the level of education changes. One set of conditions applies to preschool, an entirely different one to doctoral studies. So we need to break things down.</p><p></p><p>A standard curriculum would benefit students who are highly mobile. It’s not unusual for a student in this century to attend a half-dozen schools while working on one credential. Anyone who’s changed schools—even if it’s not in the middle of a school year—will witness that it’s disconcerting because you’ll be ahead in some subjects—therefore bored—and behind in others—therefore befuddled. So it benefits a transient student.</p><p></p><p>The downside would be a loss of any diversity or specialization.</p><p></p><p>Is there a way to balance those costs and rewards? I think so. If I were Grand Poobah of US education, I’d drop the local controldelusion and institute a national system. Then I’d institute an age- and ability-appropriate curriculum, as follows.</p><p></p><p>Three modes of instruction at all levels: one for special-needs students, which would use the proven methods of that specialization; one for the top 15% or so, which would be salf-paced and more self-directed; the remainder of students in traditional classes with direct instruction. Mastery learning across the board.</p><p></p><p>Then I’d address the curriculum at various levels. In the earliest grades, I’d standardize, I’d focus on language skills (why d’ya think they call it grammar school?), math, foreign language, visual arts and Orff style music and physical activity. Include some simple science and history.</p><p></p><p>As the student moves into higher grades, the curriculum gets more diverse. In the upper elementary grades we’d get to algebra, we’d increase science and social studies, music would become more of an elective, physical education would become more disciplined.</p><p></p><p>Entering secondary school, curriculum becomes more specialized. We get magnet schools for arts, sciences, sports. We maintain core subjects, but in the later grades we’d begin to address those developing adult capacities for critical thinking, inquiry, creativity, and ethics.</p><p></p><p>Higher education would have a standardized general education curriculum, so that all students would still build competency in composition,, communication, -math, lab science, social sciences, humanities and arts—and with less of the scattershot cafeteria of gen ed classes that universities have adopted. Yes, let’s nestle a diversity requirement in that part of the curriculum—and let’s consider reducing the number of gen ed credits and focusing more on the major and electives. Curriculum in the major should be entirely up to the individual academic departments to exploit the strengths of individual faculty.</p><p></p><p>At the graduate level, curriculum should not be standardized at all.</p><br />

                            6. what are the possible pitfalls of a standard- based curriculum​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>“What are the possible pitfalls of standard-based curriculum?”</p><p></p><p>The pitfalls are clearly obvious from studying the devastation caused by the Islamic terrorist-funded “Common Core Curriculum” which teaches children the “virtues” of Islam in a manner totally in keeping with Islamic “taqiyya” (divinely sanctioned deception of infidels / non-Muslims by Muslims for the purpose of spreading Islam.) Any ideology that requires deception in order to spread is nothing more than the survival of deception. Making the CCC a national standard was the worst mistake ever perpetuated against our children, which directly led to the weakened minds of young adults thinking that Obama’s importing Islamic terrorists directly into our small towns was somehow a good idea.</p><p></p><p>Think of it this way: a ROPE or steel cable is formed by multiple strands woven and twisted together. A single strand of rope material or a single strand of a steel wire may easily be broken or cut. When the entire nation is teaching a single curriculum, the minds of the nation, our children becoming adults, and their children thereafter, are progressively rendered weaker and weaker, as the rope or cable of knowledge is reduced to a single strand or wire.</p><p></p><p>Allowing States to determine their own curriculum standards allows for a far greater diversity of knowledge and specialization across the entire spectrum. What is not studied in Boston may be studied in Los Angeles. What’s not studied in Huntsville Alabama may be studied in Racine Wisconsin. The seeds of knowledge that are passed on, evolve, harvested, and planted for the future continue to create a stronger, unified nation of greater diversity. (The more strands or wires of knowledge that go into the rope or cable, the stronger the rope or cable becomes.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Yan po answer ko..</p><p><strong>"</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong> </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>G</strong><strong>"</strong><strong>[</strong><strong>¤</strong><strong>_</strong><strong>¤</strong><strong>]</strong></p><p>SANA PO MAKATULONG</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. SCRAMBLING EGGS OVER A HIGH HEAT
</p><p>When scrambling eggs you need to choose a low flame to make sure they cook just right. Turning up the heat won’t make them cook faster, but may cause them to catch, dry out and turn crispy on the bottom.  </p><p>
</p><p>Scrambled Eggs
</p><p>2. WALKING AWAY FROM SCRAMBLED EGGS
</p><p>If you find your eggs turn out hard and flat, rather than light and fluffy, you may be guilty of not stirring them enough as they cook. After adding the beaten eggs to a hot pan, use a rubber spatula to keep it moving, and get ready to remove the pan from the heat just before they’re done cooking.  </p><p>
</p><p>3. COOKING HARD BOILED EGGS IN BOILING WATER
</p><p>To prevent your hard boiled eggs from cracking, start them off in cold water and slowly increase the temperature. Make sure they’re well covered with water and that there’s enough space for them to move around in the pot.

</p><p>4. LETTING THE EGGS BOIL
</p><p>When cooking hard-boiled eggs, once your eggs come to the boil, turn the heat down low and let them gently cook for 4 minutes for soft boiled eggs, and 8 minutes for hard boiled eggs. If you allow them to boil you risk the shells cracking, and for them overcooking and taking on a grey tinge around the outside of the yolk.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. NOT UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF FRESH EGGS
</p><p>Depending on how you want to cook your eggs, you’ll need to know how freshness plays a role. For hard boiled, you don’t want eggs that are too fresh as they contain too much moisture causing the whites to stick to the shells. However, on the flip side, you need the freshest eggs possible for poaching to ensure the white stays attached to the yolk.

</p><p>6. CHOOSING THE WRONG PAN
</p><p>Make sure you use the right pan for the job. Boiled eggs need enough room to sit in a single layer and have enough water to cover them. Poached eggs need to be cooked in a shallow, wide pan where they have plenty of room to move. Scrambled eggs should be cooked in a small fry-pan to avoid them overcooking and burning.

</p><p>7. OVERCOOKING THE EGGS
</p><p>By far the number one problem with cooking eggs is getting the timing wrong and overcooking them. Scrambled eggs should only be cooked long enough that they are barely set as the residual heat will continue to cook them after you turn off the heat. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            22. History helps the government avoid pitfalls of the present</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>History as a discipline is not only useful in the academic arena but also to the field of intelligence.  The study of history helps one discern what the story is, instead of what the problem is; it helps to determine the who, what, when, where, how and the why of a narrative.[2] By studying history, intelligence agencies can learn from past mistakes and aim to improve their performance.  But at the same time, these lessons gathered from intelligence successes or failures do have restrictions.  This paper argues on three epistemological limitations to the use of history as a learning tool.  First, history can be interpreted in different ways; second, history can be misunderstood, and third, history will always have gaps. It is an incomplete story. Despite these limitations, however, the study of history is a useful tool for intelligence historians. History can clarify events, and offer guidance and guidelines for decisions to intelligence practitioners; it serves as a way to uncover past intelligence practices and expands intelligence history as an academic discipline.</p><p></p><p>History is of limited use due the variability of perceptions and the bias of the interpreter.  Personal interpretations of history can be taken out of context.  On the one hand, the study of history can be used as a way to measure an organization’s strengths and weaknesses in a way that makes room for future progress.  On the other hand, interpreters explain a small fragment of a given story; in other words, as Gaddis says:  ‘he or she never perceives more than a tiny patch of the vast tapestry of events.’[3]  Because history can be viewed as a construction of events, such a construction depends heavily on the person who is telling the story.  History is composed of facts, but facts do not speak for themselves; the interpreter speaks for the facts.[4]  It is the reader (and interpreter) of history who ascribes the meaning in order to adapt these facts to the story he or she wants to tell.[5]  From this perspective, history is inevitably biased.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Historians can only do so much in interpreting events, as the past is something that historians can only represent.[6]  The only way in which history could be employed reliably is if they could travel back in time and objectively witness the events. However, while users and interpreters of history cannot rerun history as a chemist can rerun an experiment, they can do so with their minds working as their laboratories.[7]</p><p></p><p>That being said, the degree to which history can be implemented as an intelligence tool actually depends on how it is interpreted and whose history is chosen for analysis.[8]  For example, under the umbrella of intelligence studies, there are many histories regarding MI5; however, if one was to use these histories as learning tools for subsequent organizational improvements then one would be more willing to rely on Christopher Andrew’s ‘In Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5,’ an authoritative work based on MI5’s archives.  During the elaboration of this work Christopher Andrews had full unrestricted access to MI5’s twentieth-century files as well as to the more restricted twenty-first century records.[9] Such opportunities provide the historian to interpret new information about an organization.  In the intelligence literature, official histories are significant because they uncover many pieces of the puzzles that are missing from the other histories due to high document classification.  However, one has to bear in mind that even this prospect may be flawed due to the bias carried out by the historian interpreting the documents.  In other words, the historian might interpret history the way the organization being examined wants to be perceived.  Thus, the limitation is imposed through the actions of historians themselves, since histories are never handed down to us directly and objectively.[10]  As E. H. Carr notes: “It is the historian who decides to which facts to give the floor, and in what order or context.”[11] One can say that to certain degree the use of history is restricted by the historian who interprets it.  History, therefore, is a handmade tool that takes its shape according to the historian’s perception.</p><br />

                        What are the benefits and possible pitfalls of subject design and integrated design

Integrated design
Many education departments have proposed the concept of a 'Integrated Curriculum,' in which different types of knowledge and their respective disciplines are combined.
<strong>The benefits of Integrated Curriculums include not only looking at topics in depth, but also offering a practical learning environment for students by using real-life examples. </strong>
Some teachers have tried various forms of integrated curriculum where teachers from various subjects collaborated on a single project For example, if you're studying the Pyramids of Egypt, a group of math students could come in and calculate what a Pyramid might look like in terms of scale and shape. Another group of history students could help by presenting examples of how the Pyramids were constructed. Another group of science or geology students may contribute knowledge of the materials and their abilities needed to create it. Though geography students will participate by discussing Egypt's weather and conditions.
<p>
</p>Subject design  Almost all textbooks and support materials available on the educational market are grouped by topic.
Tradition also seems to lend support to the style. People have become used to and relaxed with this style, and it tends to be regarded as part of the school system and education as a whole.
Teachers understand the subject-centered program better because their teaching was built on this form of specialization.
Advocates of subject-centered design contend that this technique will help individual learners improve their academic abilities.
Subject-centered curriculum design makes curriculum preparation faster and more straightforward. Consider the time spent preparing, designing, and introducing the program. Think what happens at the first staff meeting, when each teacher is given his or her teaching load for the year and how this is to be mapped on the everyday school timetable. It is simple and easy to do in a short period of time. time.<p><strong>

She’s doing it for a whole new field of study that needs to be taught in schools. Something like it hasn't existed before, and educating each teacher independently and trusting them to get this new concept right is too difficult.
