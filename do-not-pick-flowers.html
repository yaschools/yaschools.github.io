                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bees, for example, collect pollen on their legs from the stamens—male reproductive organs—and carry it to the stigmas—female reproductive organs—of the flowers it visits. In turn, these plants provide nectar, an essential nutrient, for the pollinators. So, bees get nectar, flowers get pollen, everybody wins</p><br />
