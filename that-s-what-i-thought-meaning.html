There are numerous countries affected by the pandemic but few countries have good medical facilities. 3. The spread of the disease can be slowed down if people obey strict home quarantine but it will speed up if people keep going out. 4. At first many thought that COVID-19 is simple but it was actually quite complex affecting so many aspects of people's lives. 5.

                                            One bright morning as the Fox was following his sharp nose through the wood insearch of a bite to eat, he saw a Crow on the limb of a tree overhead. This was by nomeans, the first Crow the Fox had ever seen. What caught his attention this time andmade him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her2beak"No need to search any farther," thought sly Master Fox. "Here is a dainty bitefor my breakfast."Up he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting, and lookingup admiringly, he cried, "Good-morning, beautiful creature!"The Crow, turned her head cocked on one side, watched the Foxsuspiciously. But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not returnhis greeting."What a charming creature she is!" said the Fox. "How her feathers shine!What a beautiful form and what splendid wings! Such a wonderful Bird shouldhave a very lovely voice, since everything else about her is so perfect. Could shesings just one song, I know I should hail her Queen of Birds."Listening to these flattering words, the Crow forgot all her suspicion, and alsoher breakfast. She wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds. So she openedher beak wide to utter her loudest caw, and down fell the cheese straight into theFox's open mouth"Thank you," said Master Fox sweetly, as he walked off. "Though it is cracked,you have a voice sure enough. But where are your wits?"What is the story about?What did they do?When did the action take place?Where did the story happen?Why did the main character do (what s/he did)?​</a>

                                            SAMPLE CRITIQUE
 "Lee" published by Crime Factory (Posted by Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46:00PM)
 I recently finished a fiction anthology called "Lee." The book features seventeen short stories, all written by
 crime writers and inspired by Lee Marvin - his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the
 first taking place in 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goofy
 and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had
 published two of my short stories. I liked what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else
 they've brought to the world.
 I am happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns
 out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled
 the task of writing a Lee Marvin-inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: Just Swell," "Cameron Ashley,
 ""1967: The Gun Hunter." Eric Beetner's novel The Devil Doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three or
 my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June.
 I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with these writers tangentially.
 Finishing "Lee" has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched The Man who Sho
 Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I'd seen
 another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff, but I took a step forward
 correcting this oversight last night by watching The Dirty Dozen - awesome!
 1. Where does the writer present some background and summary of the text?
 2. Would you say the background information about the text is enough? Why?
 3. What does the writer say about the different narrative elements?
 4. Is the evaluation exhaustive? Why yes? Why not?
 Consider these:
 o Notice that the writer presents the background and the summary in the first paragraph.
 o
 However, the background is not enough to inform the readers what "Lee" is all about, making them unable to
 relate to the critic's impressions about it.
 o Actually, there was no evident attempt to analyze the plot, characters, and others. What is obvious are the writer'
 s personal reactions to "Lee" and his failure to support his judgement about the material. In other words, this
 sample critique fails to make an in-depth evaluation of the text; hence, it is really not informative.
 o Thus, the evaluation was not exhaustive. There wasn't any exhaustive analysis of the material to really support
 the critic's evaluation. He seems very familiar with the material, and he could do a better critique of it.</a>

                            4. One bright morning as the Fox was following his sharp nose through the wood insearch of a bite to eat, he saw a Crow on the limb of a tree overhead. This was by nomeans, the first Crow the Fox had ever seen. What caught his attention this time andmade him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her2beak"No need to search any farther," thought sly Master Fox. "Here is a dainty bitefor my breakfast."Up he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting, and lookingup admiringly, he cried, "Good-morning, beautiful creature!"The Crow, turned her head cocked on one side, watched the Foxsuspiciously. But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not returnhis greeting."What a charming creature she is!" said the Fox. "How her feathers shine!What a beautiful form and what splendid wings! Such a wonderful Bird shouldhave a very lovely voice, since everything else about her is so perfect. Could shesings just one song, I know I should hail her Queen of Birds."Listening to these flattering words, the Crow forgot all her suspicion, and alsoher breakfast. She wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds. So she openedher beak wide to utter her loudest caw, and down fell the cheese straight into theFox's open mouth"Thank you," said Master Fox sweetly, as he walked off.

                            19. SAMPLE CRITIQUE
 "Lee" published by Crime Factory (Posted by Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46:00PM)
 I recently finished a fiction anthology called "Lee." The book features seventeen short stories, all written by
 crime writers and inspired by Lee Marvin - his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the
 first taking place in 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goofy
 and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had
 published two of my short stories. I liked what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else
 they've brought to the world.
 I am happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns
 out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled
 the task of writing a Lee Marvin-inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: Just Swell," "Cameron Ashley,
 ""1967: The Gun Hunter." Eric Beetner's novel The Devil Doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three or
 my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June.
 I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with these writers tangentially.
 Finishing "Lee" has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched The Man who Sho
 Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I'd seen
 another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff, but I took a step forward
 correcting this oversight last night by watching The Dirty Dozen - awesome!
 1. Where does the writer present some background and summary of the text?
 2. Would you say the background information about the text is enough? Why?
 3. What does the writer say about the different narrative elements?
 4. Is the evaluation exhaustive? Why yes? Why not?
 Consider these:
 o Notice that the writer presents the background and the summary in the first paragraph.
 o
 However, the background is not enough to inform the readers what "Lee" is all about, making them unable to
 relate to the critic's impressions about it.
 o Actually, there was no evident attempt to analyze the plot, characters, and others. What is obvious are the writer'
 s personal reactions to "Lee" and his failure to support his judgement about the material. In other words, this
 sample critique fails to make an in-depth evaluation of the text; hence, it is really not informative.
 o Thus, the evaluation was not exhaustive. There wasn't any exhaustive analysis of the material to really support
 the critic's evaluation. He seems very familiar with the material, and he could do a better critique of it.</h2><br />
