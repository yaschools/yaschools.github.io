Usage Rates
You might have a large audience of customers using your products, but in different levels or frequencies. In this case, usage rates might be your ideal market segmentation strategy. With this approach, you identify customers who use the product infrequently, those who are routine or regular users, those who are die-hard loyal customers and those who haven't tried the product. When you market, you either attempt to present the benefits of the product as it relates to usage levels, or you try to increase a buyer's consumption. For instance, Clorox often targets infrequent and routine users with ads promoting all of the uses of bleach to ramp up buying activity.
Price Impact
Price typically plays a key role in identifying the right segment for your products. If you develop a high-quality solution and intend to provide elite service, your customers probably would come from middle to upper class income levels. If you emphasize price or value as part of your offering, you have a larger pool of budget-conscious buyers in the lower, lower-middle or middle income classes.</a>

                        <p>Jeepney Modernization in the Philippines</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Jeepney Phase-out as a modernization of public transport in the Philippines is a hotly debated topic that has sparked various opinions and perspectives. Some argue that it is necessary to phase out old and dilapidated jeepneys to improve the quality of public transport, while others argue that the government's modernization plan is simply a ploy to benefit corporations and neglect the welfare of jeepney drivers and operators.</p><p></p><p>However, I argue that the Jeepney Phase-out as modernization of public transport in the Philippines is a necessary and important step towards improving the country's transportation system.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, the jeepney phase-out is a response to the growing need for more efficient and eco-friendly transportation options. With the increasing population and the rapid urbanization of cities, traditional jeepneys have become a significant contributor to traffic congestion, air pollution, and road accidents. By replacing old jeepneys with modern, fuel-efficient, and environment-friendly vehicles, the government can improve the quality of public transport and reduce the negative impact on the environment.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the modernization plan aims to address the issues of road safety and the welfare of drivers and operators. The new vehicles proposed for the modernization program are equipped with modern safety features such as CCTV cameras, GPS, and speed limiters, which will help prevent accidents and ensure the safety of passengers. Furthermore, the program also includes the provision of financial and non-financial assistance to jeepney drivers and operators to help them transition to the new system. This includes access to loans, training programs, and social protection programs, which will help them adapt to the changes brought by the modernization program.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, the modernization plan will also lead to the creation of job opportunities and boost the local economy. The manufacturing and maintenance of the new vehicles will create new jobs, and the new transport system will attract more tourists, which will boost the economy.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the Jeepney Phase-out as a modernization of public transport in the Philippines is a necessary and important step towards improving the country's transportation system. The program aims to address the issues of road safety, environmental impact, and the welfare of jeepney drivers and operators. While the program may face some challenges, such as the resistance from jeepney operators, it is important to focus on the long-term benefits and the improvement of the public transportation system in the Philippines.</p><br />

• Jeepney Phase-out as Modernization of Public Transport in the Philippines</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Jeepney Phase-out as Modernization of Public Transport in the Philippines</p><p></p><p>The jeepney is an iconic symbol of Philippine public transportation, but it is also known for its inefficiency and harmful environmental impact. To address these issues, the Philippine government has initiated the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program, which aims to phase out old jeepneys and replace them with newer and more environmentally friendly vehicles. While there has been opposition to the program, I believe that the jeepney phase-out is a necessary step towards modernizing public transport in the country.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the jeepney phase-out will improve the quality of public transportation in the Philippines. Newer vehicles are expected to have better engines, air conditioning systems, and safety features, which will provide a more comfortable and safer ride for commuters. Additionally, the program encourages the use of electric vehicles, which will not only reduce air pollution but also help the country achieve its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the program will also provide economic benefits. Jeepney drivers and operators will be given financial assistance to help them purchase new vehicles, which will stimulate the local economy. Moreover, the modernization program will create job opportunities for Filipinos, particularly in the production and maintenance of new vehicles.</p><p></p><p>While there are concerns about the possible displacement of jeepney drivers and operators, the government has assured that they will be given assistance to ease their transition to the new system. Overall, the jeepney phase-out is a necessary step towards modernizing public transportation in the Philippines. It is a program that is not only environmentally sustainable but also provides economic benefits for the country</p><br />

Usage Rates
You might have a large audience of customers using your products, but in different levels or frequencies. In this case, usage rates might be your ideal market segmentation strategy. With this approach, you identify customers who use the product infrequently, those who are routine or regular users, those who are die-hard loyal customers and those who haven't tried the product. When you market, you either attempt to present the benefits of the product as it relates to usage levels, or you try to increase a buyer's consumption. For instance, Clorox often targets infrequent and routine users with ads promoting all of the uses of bleach to ramp up buying activity.
Price Impact
Price typically plays a key role in identifying the right segment for your products. If you develop a high-quality solution and intend to provide elite service, your customers probably would come from middle to upper class income levels. If you emphasize price or value as part of your offering, you have a larger pool of budget-conscious buyers in the lower, lower-middle or middle income classes.</h2><br />

Gayunpaman, ang trabaho ay hindi nagbabago at kailangan niya ang lahat ng pera na makukuha niya.

Harvard University to offer Tagalog Courses will be beneficial for Philippines
E-Sports offers social experiences and valuable skills to the students
Jeepney Phase-out as Modernization of Public Transport in the Philippines</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Harvard University offering Tagalog courses would be a beneficial move for the Philippines for various reasons. Firstly, it would aid in the preservation of the Filipino language and culture. As globalization continues, many Filipino immigrants and their descendants have assimilated into other cultures, and the language has been slowly disappearing. By offering Tagalog courses at such a prestigious institution, the language can be kept alive and passed on to future generations. This would also help in promoting tourism in the country as foreigners would be more interested in learning about the culture and language of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, offering Tagalog courses at Harvard would also provide the opportunity for Filipinos to work or study in the United States. With the Philippines being a major supplier of skilled workers and professionals to the global market, the ability to speak Tagalog fluently would be an added advantage for Filipinos seeking employment in the United States. It would also be helpful for Filipino students who want to study in Harvard as they would be able to communicate with other Filipinos and would not feel left out.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, offering Tagalog courses at Harvard would help in strengthening the relationship between the Philippines and the United States. As two countries with a long history, the United States and the Philippines have a special relationship that has been built over the years. By offering Tagalog courses, Harvard would be showing its support for the Filipino community and this would, go a long way in strengthening the bond between the two countries.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Harvard University offering Tagalog courses would have numerous benefits for the Philippines. It would aid in the preservation of the Filipino language and culture, provide opportunities for Filipinos to work or study in the United States, and help to strengthen the relationship between the two countries.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ang kanilang desisyon ay mali dahil hindi ito makakatulong sa kanilang kalusugan at mali rin ang disisyon nila na kimuha ng liquor sa kanilang magugal na hindi nag papaalam</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sa tingin ko hindi tama yung desisyon nila kasi diba minor pa lang sila kaya bawal pa silang uminom ng alak. Kahit na ang reason ng pag inom nila ay para mag saya. Hindi parin sapat yun kasi may iba pa namang paraan na maaari nilang gawin para mag celebrate hindi ang mag inom. At tsaka alam nila na magagalit yung parents nila pag nalaman na uminom sila pero ginawa parin nilang uminom. I can say that this is quite connected with peer pressure.
