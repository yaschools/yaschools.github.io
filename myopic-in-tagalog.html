Mirrors come in different types. The first one is the (3)_______
type of mirror with a flat surface, it produces an image flipped vertically, this is
known as (4)______. When mirrors are placed next to each other at a certain
angle it can create more than one images, known as (5)______. When
mirrors are placed in (6)_____ position, facing each other, an infinite
number of images is produced. The spherical mirrors come in two: (7)______
or the converging mirror and (8)_______ the diverging mirror.
These mirrors also function differently. A mirror which provides wider view
field making distant objects appear smaller is (9)______. If you want to
increase the beam that a certain source of light is radiating, you must enclose it in a

teeth they are checking on, and this makes easier for them to find the hidden cavity.​

                            20. In a nearsighted /myopic eye, the image of a far object is focused in front ofthe retina while in a farsighted /hyperopic eye, the image is focused behind theretina . How are you going to correct these eye defects using diverging andconverging lenses? Explain.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The nearsighted (myopic) eye converges rays from a distant object in front of the retina; thus, they are diverging when they strike the retina, producing a blurry image. This can be caused by the lens of the eye being too powerful or the length of the eye being too great. (b) The farsighted (hyperopic) eye is unable to converge the rays from a close object by the time they strike the retina, producing blurry close vision. This can be caused by insufficient power in the lens or by the eye being too short.</p><br />
