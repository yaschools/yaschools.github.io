                            24. Make a 10 lines creed out of this 
Jesus is the Lord he sacrificed himself for the sins of people be forgiven by the all mighty God and also in other words Jesus is a saviour of he ressurects people who were very close and people who he really loved like lazarus also in John 14:3 it says that "Jesus is the way the truth and the life"which means for me that if we make a conversation with God and after that we always have to mention jesus' name for our prayers to reach for the God</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I repeat the idea that because Jesus died on the cross for you and me to be forgiven, God also sent His only begotten Son to preach the gospel and do His will as He said so. For the word of God, as it is written in his holy word, says, Except, by me, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. If we do not go through Jesus we cannot go through or enter the kingdom of God or eternal life. Let that be your opinion or your assistance in the preaching of the Word of God.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it works.</p><br />
