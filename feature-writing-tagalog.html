Kailangang matuto ang mga mag-aaral at kailangang magturo ang mga guro. Sa personal, hindi ako tagahanga ng mga klase sa online. Sa palagay ko idinagdag ang stress para sa mga mag-aaral na walang computer at / o pag-access sa Internet sa bahay.

The <strong>exosphere</strong> is the most distant atmospheric region from Earth's surface.</p><p>2. The<strong> ionosphere </strong>stretches roughly 50 to 400 miles above Earth's surface, right at the edge of space. Along with the neutral upper atmosphere, the ionosphere forms the boundary between Earth's lower atmosphere — where we live and breathe — and the vacuum of space.</p><p>3. The <strong>mesosphere</strong> is the least-understood part of Earth's atmosphere. It is too high for aircraft or weather balloons to operate, but too low for spacecraft</p><p>4. <strong>Stratosphere</strong>. The next layer up is called the stratosphere. The stratosphere extends from the top of the troposphere to about 50 km (31 miles) above the ground. The infamous ozone layer is found within the stratosphere.</p><p>5. Above: The space shuttle orbits in the <strong>thermosphere</strong>, a tenuous layer of our atmosphere that gets hotter and expands during solar maximum. The puffed-up<strong> thermosphere </strong>increases drag on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites</p><p>6. <strong>Troposphere.</strong> The troposphere is the lowest layer of our atmosphere. Starting at ground level, it extends upward to about 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above sea level. We humans live in the troposphere, and nearly all weather occurs in this lowest layer. </p><p>No Worries, i did research on my answers i can assure you they are 100% correct. and i have tripled checked it, now i only wish for a thanks and a 5 star and brainliest, <strong>Thank you &amp; Welcome</strong></p><br />
