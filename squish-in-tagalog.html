Sam’s Snail
One fine morning, a boy who goes by Sam was passing through the neighbourhood at 6:30 in the morning to make it to his school early. He was thinking about what the next class pet would be as the last one sadly died of thirst. 
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw a small snail upside-down on the sidewalk. He watched the snail struggle and try it’s best to get back up. Feeling sympathetic, he tipped it over. The snail continued on its way to the busy road. When Sam tried turning the snail around to make it face the grass, it still continued to the road.
Knowing the vehicles on the road could easily squish the puny snail, he decided to simply just bring it with him to school. He grabbed the empty container his mom always packs for him just in case and carefully placed the snail inside. He looked around and noticed a flower bush. He picked a leave and placed it in the container as well.
During class hours, he’d keep the snail’s container on top of his bag as it was full and he had to watch over the little critter. The adviser of his class made her students list down all the presidents of the Philippines they knew. As she was passing by her students, checking if everyone was working, she noticed the snail container on Sam’s bag and stared at it for a few seconds. 
“Sam, may I ask about this snail on top of your bag?” She asked him picking up the container in curiosity. “Teacher, that’s a snail I found going to school this morning, it had a huge risk of dying if he continued going to the busy road so I brought it to school to keep it safe.” Sam answered. “I see…may I speak to you after class?” She looked at him. “Sure ma’am.” Sam went back to listing presidents.
“Sam, I have questions regarding the snail. You know how no one brought a new class pet for us today right?” The teacher said as she pushed her glasses up her nose. “Yes po.” The adviser looked at him, “I would like to ask you if the snail could become the next class pet? We need a replacement for Tom the Tortoise. It’s fine if not.” He thought for a bit and asked himself “Why not?” “Sure teacher, we can make him the class pet.” The adviser’s eyes lit up and a smile crept on her face.
 “Great! Say, what is the name of the little fella?” She asked. “Eum, its name is…Shelly! Shelly the Snail.” Sam blurted out the first thing that came in mind. “Alright, I’ll bring it home and find a proper container for it.”
Since it was almost the end of the school year, Shelly ended up becoming their class pet until the last day of class. During it’s time as class pet, it became so popular it became the school’s new mascot! Who knew a snail found walking to school could achieve so much?</a>

Write your answers in your notebook. 2. To the Fairest An Excerpt by Karl Oliver D. Diaz Ernesto stared at the grains of rice, carefully surveying the white field for... aha! He quickly plucked out a bug, squished it with his fingernails and dropped it to the ground. Seated nearby, Mama was doing the same: sifting through her own bilao of rice grains and removing bugs and pebbles, only much faster. Ernesto is just a boy, though, and cannot handle as much rice, so he shares a bilao with Mama's sister, Auntie Angela. She also works fast, expertly picking out dirt and palay. She gently pushed on Ernesto's forehead. Guide Questions: Have you also experienced finding and plucking a big bug while sifting through rice? Did you feel the same as the boy did in the story? What other emotions did you have? What did you feel while reading the excerpt? "Careful, Ernesto," she said. "Your sweat is about to fall on the rice. Wipe your brow."​</a>

He quicklyplucked out a bug, squished it with his fingernailsand dropped it to the ground. Seated nearby, Mamawas doing the same: sifting through her own bilaoof rice grains and removing bugs and pebbles, onlymuch faster.Ernesto is just a boy, though, and cannothandle as much rice, so he shares a bilao withMama's sister, Auntie Angela. She also worksfast, expertly picking out dirt and palay. She gentlypushed on Ernesto's forehead."Careful, Ernesto," she said. "Your sweat isabout to fall on the rice. Wipe your brow."Guide Questions:1. Have you also experienced finding and plucking a big bug while sifting throughrice? Did you feel the same as the boy did in the story? What other emotionsdid you have?2.What did you feel while reading the excerpt?​</a>

                            6. I have no question, I just wrote a story and wanted to share it lol
Sam’s Snail
One fine morning, a boy who goes by Sam was passing through the neighbourhood at 6:30 in the morning to make it to his school early. He was thinking about what the next class pet would be as the last one sadly died of thirst. 
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw a small snail upside-down on the sidewalk. He watched the snail struggle and try it’s best to get back up. Feeling sympathetic, he tipped it over. The snail continued on its way to the busy road. When Sam tried turning the snail around to make it face the grass, it still continued to the road.
Knowing the vehicles on the road could easily squish the puny snail, he decided to simply just bring it with him to school. He grabbed the empty container his mom always packs for him just in case and carefully placed the snail inside. He looked around and noticed a flower bush. He picked a leave and placed it in the container as well.
During class hours, he’d keep the snail’s container on top of his bag as it was full and he had to watch over the little critter. The adviser of his class made her students list down all the presidents of the Philippines they knew. As she was passing by her students, checking if everyone was working, she noticed the snail container on Sam’s bag and stared at it for a few seconds. 
“Sam, may I ask about this snail on top of your bag?” She asked him picking up the container in curiosity. “Teacher, that’s a snail I found going to school this morning, it had a huge risk of dying if he continued going to the busy road so I brought it to school to keep it safe.” Sam answered. “I see…may I speak to you after class?” She looked at him. “Sure ma’am.” Sam went back to listing presidents.
“Sam, I have questions regarding the snail. You know how no one brought a new class pet for us today right?” The teacher said as she pushed her glasses up her nose. “Yes po.” The adviser looked at him, “I would like to ask you if the snail could become the next class pet? We need a replacement for Tom the Tortoise. It’s fine if not.” He thought for a bit and asked himself “Why not?” “Sure teacher, we can make him the class pet.” The adviser’s eyes lit up and a smile crept on her face.
 “Great! Say, what is the name of the little fella?” She asked. “Eum, its name is…Shelly! Shelly the Snail.” Sam blurted out the first thing that came in mind. “Alright, I’ll bring it home and find a proper container for it.”
Since it was almost the end of the school year, Shelly ended up becoming their class pet until the last day of class. During it’s time as class pet, it became so popular it became the school’s new mascot! Who knew a snail found walking to school could achieve so much?</h2><br />

To the Fairest An Excerpt by Karl Oliver D. Diaz Ernesto stared at the grains of rice, carefully surveying the white field for... aha! He quickly plucked out a bug, squished it with his fingernails and dropped it to the ground. Seated nearby, Mama was doing the same: sifting through her own bilao of rice grains and removing bugs and pebbles, only much faster. Ernesto is just a boy, though, and cannot handle as much rice, so he shares a bilao with Mama's sister, Auntie Angela. She also works fast, expertly picking out dirt and palay. She gently pushed on Ernesto's forehead. Guide Questions: Have you also experienced finding and plucking a big bug while sifting through rice? Did you feel the same as the boy did in the story? What other emotions did you have? What did you feel while reading the excerpt? "Careful, Ernesto," she said. "Your sweat is about to fall on the rice. Wipe your brow."​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. I haven't tried doing that yet, but I saw my relatives constantly doing it for they are farmers.
