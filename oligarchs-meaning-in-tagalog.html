Below is a sample definition of democracy by Saqueton and Uychoco (2016). Read the text then fill out the table that follows. 
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally – either directly or through elected representatives – in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.
It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. 
The term originates from the Greek “demokratia” or rule of the people, which was coined from “demos” (people) and “kratos” (power or rule) in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems them existing in Greek city-states, notable Athens. 
The term is an antonym to ‘aristokratia’ which means ‘rule of an elite’. WBLS-OBE MELC-Aligned Self-Learning Module English 11 - EAPP 10 While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice, the distinction has been blurred historically. 
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. 
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of all elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. 
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. 
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 
There were five (5) techniques used in defining the concept. Your challenge is to identify all five and write the sentences where these techniques can be found.

                                            Text A TWO European friends of mine who react positively to most of my columns nevertheless tell me the Philippines is a hopeless case and I am just Railing in the dark Frankly. I agree but with great reluctances cannot give up on my country, The Philippines needs socio-economic structural reforms like a dehydrated man in the Sahara desert needs water. Marginalized Filipinos, the vast majority, will never have a voice in government or a fair share of the country's material wealth unless management of it is taken away from the ruling oligarchs Orlando P Carvajal, Sunstar Text B My alarm starts to ning at 6:30 AM. In a few minutes I'm awake enough to find the off switch. After few moments of hiding under the blankets, I slide down the bed and into the bathroom. Most momings. I look into the mirror and see puffy eyes and colorless cheeks. As I wash my face. I promise myself that I will get more sleep, but I know I'll be up late again tonight ... I'm not the only high school student losing sleep, others are taking so many advanced courses that they dream of nights with only a few hours of homework. Why do we do this to ourselves? We're not addicted to stress and not all of us are overachievers. The numerous teens who push themselves academically have their own personal justifications, but nearly every high school student who works into the early morning hours is after one thing acceptance to a "good" college.

                                            The Philippines’ COVID-19 Response: Securitising the Pandemic and Disciplining the Pasaway Karl Hapal (2021) Duterte has securitised COVID-19. This was achieved by fulfilling the three main elements of securitisation – the identification of an existential threat, emergency measures, and breaking free of rules. The securitisation of COVID-19 relied on framing the pandemic as war – a fight for the nation‟s survival. This was used to justify the draconian response by the government in an attempt to suppress the spread of the virus. This was primarily achieved by utilising and expanding the powers of the state‟s law enforcement apparatus. While Duterte has successfully securitised COVID-19, he has done so in a peculiar way. Duterte‟s securitising act relied on his populist rhetoric – a populist securitising act so to speak. Seen this way, Duterte‟s populist rhetoric served as the speech act that argued for and legitimised the securitisation of COVID-19. A key element of his populist securitising act was projecting the Philippines under siege by a sinister menace that may undermine the well-being of Filipinos. Duterte‟s populist securitising act invariably produced the pasaway archetype, an erring and bullheaded subject who, through its behaviour, became the embodiment of the virus‟ deadly qualities. Consequently, this was used to justify the intense policing and disciplining campaign against the pasaway. The war against COVID-19 turned into a war against the pasaway. The war against the pasaway is an attempt by the government to protect virtuous citizens from an unwanted and undesirable “other.” The disproportionate focus on the pasaway, however, is not only to mitigate its bullheaded behaviour. It is also informed by deep-seated class prejudices – the pasaway, in some ways, resembling the colonised and racialised other. The bifurcated narrative and the concomitant legitimisation of the use of the state‟s coercive power have long been used to produce, maintain, and reinforce societal divides. Beyond class, however, the underlying discourse that informed the production of the pasaway soon spread to other groups‟ perceived derailing of governmental efforts against the virus. In this sense, the pasaway became an empty signifier representing any other behaviour or actions deemed disagreeable. As an empty signifier, the campaign to address the pasaway extended to not only arresting bullheaded individuals but also to silence dissent. While the pasaway has become an encompassing pejorative term, it still relied on the bifurcated depiction of Filipino society and the need to save the virtuous from the errant. These dualist and oppositional narratives are, however, not new. They resemble what has informed and animated Duterte‟s campaigns against illegal drugs, criminality, corruption, oligarchy, communism, and so on. These narratives serve to present a bifurcated society, an existential threat, and an accompanying justification to pursue actions with force and haste in the name of social justice and national integrity. Take, for example, the war on drugs. Duterte depicted the widespread sale and use of illegal drugs as “a clear national security threat […] an invasion of a new kind […] [and] a war against our families and children” (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2020). Moreover, Duterte was able to frame the war on drugs as a noble crusade to salvage the Filipino nation (Hapal, 2019). In this crusade, society is seen as composed of good people and of demons (demonyo). The role of the government (particularly law enforcement) is “predictably, like avenging angels, to eliminate the demons to protect society – in other words, to keep the integrity of the „thin blue line‟” (Jensen and Hapal, 2018: 49). In this sense, the war against COVID-19 may be understood in conjunction with Duterte‟s other “wars on […]” Amid the pandemic, the government relentlessly continued its war on drugs, criminality, and corruption; intensified its war against terrorism alongside the passage of the controversial Anti-Terrorism Law; and escalated its campaign to dismantle so-called oligarchs, ABS-CBN – the largest media network in the Philippines – as one of the casualties. These wars are being fought to address a clear and present threat to ensure the well-being and future of the nation. And, more importantly, it presents an enemy to vanquish. The war on COVID-19 had serious consequences. Through the archetype of the pasaway, the government has, wittingly or unwittingly, turned the Filipino people into the enemy. This came to be as the virus, initially conceived as an “unseen enemy” creeping to infect, kill, and upend the lives of Filipinos, took a corporeal form. In other words, COVID-19‟s deadly and devastating qualities were soon embodied with the bullheaded character of the pasaway. It became the enemy order and, consequently, the object of disciplining and punishment. pasagot namn sa nakakaalam maraming salamat​</a>

                            7. Direction: 
Below is a sample definition of democracy by Saqueton and Uychoco (2016). Read the text then fill out the table that follows. 
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally – either directly or through elected representatives – in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.
It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. 
The term originates from the Greek “demokratia” or rule of the people, which was coined from “demos” (people) and “kratos” (power or rule) in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems them existing in Greek city-states, notable Athens. 
The term is an antonym to ‘aristokratia’ which means ‘rule of an elite’. WBLS-OBE MELC-Aligned Self-Learning Module English 11 - EAPP 10 While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice, the distinction has been blurred historically. 
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. 
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of all elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. 
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. 
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 
There were five (5) techniques used in defining the concept. Your challenge is to identify all five and write the sentences where these techniques can be found.

I look into the mirror and see puffy eyes and colorless cheeks. As I wash my face. I promise myself that I will get more sleep, but I know I'll be up late again tonight ... I'm not the only high school student losing sleep, others are taking so many advanced courses that they dream of nights with only a few hours of homework. Why do we do this to ourselves?

                            15. The Philippines’ COVID-19 Response: Securitising the Pandemic and Disciplining the Pasaway Karl Hapal (2021) Duterte has securitised COVID-19. This was achieved by fulfilling the three main elements of securitisation – the identification of an existential threat, emergency measures, and breaking free of rules. The securitisation of COVID-19 relied on framing the pandemic as war – a fight for the nation‟s survival. This was used to justify the draconian response by the government in an attempt to suppress the spread of the virus. This was primarily achieved by utilising and expanding the powers of the state‟s law enforcement apparatus. While Duterte has successfully securitised COVID-19, he has done so in a peculiar way. Duterte‟s securitising act relied on his populist rhetoric – a populist securitising act so to speak. Seen this way, Duterte‟s populist rhetoric served as the speech act that argued for and legitimised the securitisation of COVID-19. A key element of his populist securitising act was projecting the Philippines under siege by a sinister menace that may undermine the well-being of Filipinos. Duterte‟s populist securitising act invariably produced the pasaway archetype, an erring and bullheaded subject who, through its behaviour, became the embodiment of the virus‟ deadly qualities. Consequently, this was used to justify the intense policing and disciplining campaign against the pasaway. The war against COVID-19 turned into a war against the pasaway. The war against the pasaway is an attempt by the government to protect virtuous citizens from an unwanted and undesirable “other.” The disproportionate focus on the pasaway, however, is not only to mitigate its bullheaded behaviour. It is also informed by deep-seated class prejudices – the pasaway, in some ways, resembling the colonised and racialised other. The bifurcated narrative and the concomitant legitimisation of the use of the state‟s coercive power have long been used to produce, maintain, and reinforce societal divides. Beyond class, however, the underlying discourse that informed the production of the pasaway soon spread to other groups‟ perceived derailing of governmental efforts against the virus. In this sense, the pasaway became an empty signifier representing any other behaviour or actions deemed disagreeable. As an empty signifier, the campaign to address the pasaway extended to not only arresting bullheaded individuals but also to silence dissent. While the pasaway has become an encompassing pejorative term, it still relied on the bifurcated depiction of Filipino society and the need to save the virtuous from the errant. These dualist and oppositional narratives are, however, not new. They resemble what has informed and animated Duterte‟s campaigns against illegal drugs, criminality, corruption, oligarchy, communism, and so on. These narratives serve to present a bifurcated society, an existential threat, and an accompanying justification to pursue actions with force and haste in the name of social justice and national integrity. Take, for example, the war on drugs. Duterte depicted the widespread sale and use of illegal drugs as “a clear national security threat […] an invasion of a new kind […] [and] a war against our families and children” (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2020). Moreover, Duterte was able to frame the war on drugs as a noble crusade to salvage the Filipino nation (Hapal, 2019). In this crusade, society is seen as composed of good people and of demons (demonyo). The role of the government (particularly law enforcement) is “predictably, like avenging angels, to eliminate the demons to protect society – in other words, to keep the integrity of the „thin blue line‟” (Jensen and Hapal, 2018: 49). In this sense, the war against COVID-19 may be understood in conjunction with Duterte‟s other “wars on […]” Amid the pandemic, the government relentlessly continued its war on drugs, criminality, and corruption; intensified its war against terrorism alongside the passage of the controversial Anti-Terrorism Law; and escalated its campaign to dismantle so-called oligarchs, ABS-CBN – the largest media network in the Philippines – as one of the casualties. These wars are being fought to address a clear and present threat to ensure the well-being and future of the nation. And, more importantly, it presents an enemy to vanquish. The war on COVID-19 had serious consequences. Through the archetype of the pasaway, the government has, wittingly or unwittingly, turned the Filipino people into the enemy. This came to be as the virus, initially conceived as an “unseen enemy” creeping to infect, kill, and upend the lives of Filipinos, took a corporeal form. In other words, COVID-19‟s deadly and devastating qualities were soon embodied with the bullheaded character of the pasaway. It became the enemy order and, consequently, the object of disciplining and punishment. pasagot namn sa nakakaalam maraming salamat​</h2><br />
