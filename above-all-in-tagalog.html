Retaining walls may be constructed of masonry or sheet piles Whatever may be the type of wall, all the walls listed above have to withstand lateral pressures either from NT earth or any other material on their faces. The pressures acting on the walls try to move the walls from their position. The walls should be so designed as to keep them stable in their position. Gravity walls resist movement because of their heavy sections. They are built of mass concrete or stone or brick masonry. A No reinforcement is required in these walls. in all these cases, the backfill tries to move the wall from its position. The movement of the wall is partly resisted by the wall itself and partly by soil in front of the wall. Sheet pile walls are more flexible than the other types​</a>

Retaining walls may be constructed of masonry or sheet piles Whatever may be the type of wall, all the walls listed above have to withstand lateral pressures either from NT earth or any other material on their faces. The pressures acting on the walls try to move the walls from their position. The walls should be so designed as to keep them stable in their position. Gravity walls resist movement because of their heavy sections. They are built of mass concrete or stone or brick masonry. A No reinforcement is required in these walls. in all these cases, the backfill tries to move the wall from its position.
