                                             The Monkey and the Turtle The turtle and the monkey once found a banana tree floating amidst the waves of a river. It was a very fine tree, with large green leaves and with roots, just as if it had been pulled off by a storm. They took it ashore. "Let us divide it," said Turtle, "and plant each its portion." They cut it in the middle...and the monkey, as the stronger, took for himself the upper part of the tree, thinking that it would grow quicker, for it had leaves. The turtle, as the weaker, had the lower part that looked ugly, although it had roots "Hello, Mr. Monkey." After some days, they met. "Alas, * answered the monkey, it has been dead a long time. "And yours, Miss Turtle?" Very nice, indeed, with leaves and fruits. Only I cannot climb up to gather them." "Never mind," said the malicious monkey. "I will climb and pick them for you." "Do, Mr. Monkey," replied the turtle gratefully. And so they walked toward the turtle's house. As soon as the monkey saw the bright yellow fruits hanging between the large green leaves, he climbed up and began...plundering. munching, and gobbling, as quickly as he could. "But give me some, too," said the turtle, seeing that the monkey did not take the slightest notice of her "Not even a bit of the skin, if it is eatable," rejoined the monkey, both his cheeks crammed with bananas. The turtle meditated revenge. She went to the river, picked up some pointed snails, planted them around the banana tree, and hid herself under a coconut shell. When the monkey came down, he hurt himself and began to bleed. After a long search...he found the turtle. "You wretched creature, here you arel* said he. "You must now pay for your wickedness. You must die!" "But as I am very generous, I will leave you the choice of your death. Shall I pound you in a mortar, or shall I throw you into the water? Which do you prefer?" *The mortar, the mortarl" answered the turtle. "Tam so afraid of getting drowned." "O hol" laughed the monkey, "Indeed! You are afraid of getting drowned! Now I will drown you." And going to the shore, he slung the turtle and threw it in the water. But soon the turtle reappeared swimming and laughing at the deceived, artful monkey 10​</a>

Decantation</p><p>8. Sieving</p><p>9. Magnetism</p><p>10. Decantation</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Mixtures are a physical combination of different substances. </strong>The components of mixtures retain their identity and composition. Their components can be separated. </p><p></p><p>Below are some separation techniques: </p><p><strong>Hand picking</strong> is a technique if the mixture is made of materials that are large enough to be picked by hand. It is also one of the various methods which are carried out in dry conditions</p><p></p><p><strong>Sieving</strong> is a method of separating solid mixtures of different sizes. It makes use of sieve wherein materials of smaller size are allowed to pass through the sieve, leaving the larger components. </p><p></p><p><strong>Decantation</strong> is the process of separating components of a suspension. A suspension is made of liquid and insoluble solid. In this process, the liquid is removed from the solid or liquid layer below by tilting the mixture and pouring out the top layer. This process can also be used to separate two immiscible (non-mixing) liquids e.g., oil and water. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Evaporation</strong> is a technique used to separate out homogenous mixtures where the solid is dissolved in a liquid. This method allows the liquid components to evaporate and separate from the solid components, leaving the solid component. The process usually involves heating the mixture until no more liquid is left.</p><p></p><p><strong>Distillation</strong> is a method to separate mixtures comprised of two or more liquids. In this process, the components of a liquid mixture are vaporized and then condensed and isolated. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><br />

                            22.  The Monkey and the Turtle The turtle and the monkey once found a banana tree floating amidst the waves of a river. It was a very fine tree, with large green leaves and with roots, just as if it had been pulled off by a storm. They took it ashore. "Let us divide it," said Turtle, "and plant each its portion." They cut it in the middle...and the monkey, as the stronger, took for himself the upper part of the tree, thinking that it would grow quicker, for it had leaves. The turtle, as the weaker, had the lower part that looked ugly, although it had roots "Hello, Mr. Monkey." After some days, they met. "Alas, * answered the monkey, it has been dead a long time. "And yours, Miss Turtle?" Very nice, indeed, with leaves and fruits. Only I cannot climb up to gather them." "Never mind," said the malicious monkey. "I will climb and pick them for you." "Do, Mr. Monkey," replied the turtle gratefully. And so they walked toward the turtle's house. As soon as the monkey saw the bright yellow fruits hanging between the large green leaves, he climbed up and began...plundering. munching, and gobbling, as quickly as he could. "But give me some, too," said the turtle, seeing that the monkey did not take the slightest notice of her "Not even a bit of the skin, if it is eatable," rejoined the monkey, both his cheeks crammed with bananas. The turtle meditated revenge. She went to the river, picked up some pointed snails, planted them around the banana tree, and hid herself under a coconut shell. When the monkey came down, he hurt himself and began to bleed. After a long search...he found the turtle. "You wretched creature, here you arel* said he. "You must now pay for your wickedness. You must die!" "But as I am very generous, I will leave you the choice of your death. Shall I pound you in a mortar, or shall I throw you into the water? Which do you prefer?" *The mortar, the mortarl" answered the turtle. "Tam so afraid of getting drowned." "O hol" laughed the monkey, "Indeed! You are afraid of getting drowned! Now I will drown you." And going to the shore, he slung the turtle and threw it in the water. But soon the turtle reappeared swimming and laughing at the deceived, artful monkey 10​</h2><br />
