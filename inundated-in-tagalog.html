Climate Risk Profile: Philippines The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including sea level rise, increased frequency of extreme weather events, rising temperatures and extreme rainfall due to its high exposure to natural hazards (cyclones, landslides, floods, droughts), dependence on climate-sensitive natural resources and vast coastlines. The Philippines lies in the world's most cyclone-prone region, averaging 19-20 cyclones each year, of which 7-9 make landfall as a result, sea levels in the Philippines are rising faster than the global average, increasing the hazard posed by storm surges and threatening permanent inundation of low-lying areas. A rich yet increasingly depleted natural and marine resources base supports livelihoods through fisheries, agriculture, forestry, energy, mining and tourism and provides critical ecosystem services such as shoreline protection, flood control, soil stability and habitats for biodiversity. pasagot po ng maayos plss lang​</a>

                                            TRUE OR FALSE 1. Wind is usually blown to the west along the equator in the pacific region. 2. A la Niña is caused by strengthening of the easterly trade winds which blows more warm water toward the west and allows the upwelling of cold water in the east. 3. A storm surge is a localized unusual increase of sea water level beyond the predicted astronomical tide level primarily due to the intense winds and lowered atmospheric pressure during the passage of an intense tropical cyclone from the sea to the lands. 4. Floods is the inundation of land areas which are not normally covered by water. 5. Catastrophic flooding may result from ground failure and/or major infrastructure failure 6. Astronomical high tide is a short term sea level rise caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on the earth's waters. 7. EL NIÑO is a prolonged unusual warming of sea surface temperatures in the central equatorial pacific (international dateline or 180' longitude) and the eastern equatorial pacific.8. The El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) is a natural climatic phenomenon characterized mainly by cyclic fluctuation of warm and cold sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure in the central and eastern equatorial pacific. 9. Tsunami pertains to seismic sea wave. 10. The Philippines is very prone to storm surges because of its location near the equator in the pacific region, and due to its extensive coastline length.​</a>

The Philippines is blessed with a large number of rivers, lakes and streams.2. Flash floods develop in hilly and mountainous terrains where the slope of the river is rather steep.3. Flash floods inevitable.4. There are two types offloods.5. When the flow capacity of the stream exceeded, the channel overflows and the result is a flash flood.6. The technical definition is rather inadequate. Thus, considering the intents and purposes of flood forecasting and warning, the definition seems rather restrictive in its connotation for the public.7. Flood is "an abnormal progressive rise in the water level of a stream that may result in theover•flowing by the water of the normal confines of the stream with the subsequent inundation of areas which are not normally submerged.8. Flash floods also happen in other countries and it can’t be predicted that’s why it has killed a lot of people. If you are not prepared you’ll be shocked with what will happen.9. The definition merely describes a characteristic behavior.10. The Philippines has a fairly well-defined wet season. ​</a>

Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper.Forthwith Kadunong described the ancient land and spoke of its first hero, Baltog, a white Aryan, who had come from Boltavara (Bharata-varsha or India). He planted a linsa patch in Tondol (now in Kamalig) which, one night, was foraged by a giant wild boar (Tandayag). The furious Baltog chased the Tandayag, killed with his bare hands, and hung its enormous jawbones on a talisay tree in front of his house in Tondol. For this marvelous feat, he was acknowledged chief of the local hunters. The clans of Panicuason and Asog came over to marvel at the monstrous wild boar in Ibalong.Next to come was Handyong. With his followers, he fought the monsters of the land. But Oryol, a wily serpent who appeared as a beautiful maiden with a seductive voice, was one whom Handyong could not destroy. Meanwhile, Oryol admired Handyong’s bravery and gallantry. Because of this, Oryol helped Handyong clear the region of ferocious beasts until peace came to the land.With Ibalong rid of wild creatures, Handyong turned to making wise laws and planting the land with linsa and rice. A period of the invention followed: boat, farming tools, weaving looms, clay wares, kitchen utensils, tree houses, and even a syllabary. Together, the people built a society with culture. It was a golden period in Ibalong when even slaves were respected under the laws of Handyong.Then came a great flood, freed by Unos, that changed the features of the land. Three volcanoes, named Hantik, Kulasi and Isarog erupted simultaneously. Inundations caused lands to sink, from which Lake Buhi came about, or rise, as in the strip of seacoast in Pasacao, Camarines Sur, and wiped out many settlements, especially the Dagatnong settlement in the Kalabanga Gulf. The Malbogong Islet mountain sank in Bato, forming a lake.Despite the calamities, Ibalong grew powerful under Old Chief Handyong, whose constant companion and good friend, by then, was the young Bantong.Although given a thousand men to destroy the half man and half beast Rabot, who could change enemies into rocks, Bantong slew it single-handedly – to the loudcheers of these thousand warriors that reverberated throughout the forests and mangrove swamps. Brought Ligmanan, the corpse of Rabot was horrible to behold that the Great Handyong himself was shocked at the sight.1. What is the selection about?2.

                                            Performance Task 2 Cite evidence to support general statement. Direction: With the recent earthquakes that happened in Turkey and Syria, people started to realize the importance of disaster-preparedness. Read the news article given below and cite evidence using the sentence prompters below. The Philippines is among the topmost vulnerable countries in the world to natural disasters and climate impacts. Last year, the country experienced a volcanic eruption, a series of major earthquakes, and successive typhoons that inundated more than 60 towns and cities. Knowing the country's vulnerability level to disasters, various government agencies rolled out a series of apps to aid local government officials in crafting local solutions to these disasters. These solutions are based on the National Exposure Database (NED), a platform that collates data to aid in policymaking. For the Philippines, the COVID-19 pandemic wasn't the only disaster to hit the country in 2020. The year started out with a volcanic eruption and closed with two magnitude 6 earthquakes, one of them striking on Christmas morning. In between came Typhoon Goni, a late-season superstorm that was the strongest in the world last year. At least 60% of the country's total land area, nearly 300,000 square kilometers (116,000 square miles), is vulnerable to natural hazards, in large part due to the archipelago's location along both the path of the tropical storms brewing in the western Pacific and the Ring of Fire. Around 74% of its population of more than 100 million is subject to various impacts from these disasters, and the country routinely ranks among the top 10 natural disaster-prone countries in the world, according to the World Risk Index. Mitigation efforts depend on a network of early-warning systems that are constantly being fine-tuned, and on establishing mechanisms to respond more quickly to natural disasters. The latest shot of help comes from the National Exposure Database (NED), which identifies vulnerable areas so agencies and local governments can come up with real-time analyses and craft swift responses during a disaster. It also helps in planning and implementing disaster-ready solutions. The NED's primary tool for data collection and updates is GeoMapperPH, a web and mobile application that collates hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and coping capacity data from across the country. Launched last July, GeoMapperPH was developed by various government agencies led by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS). Built around a geographic information system (GIS) core, it aids in disaster prevention and mitigation by tapping the databases of at least 53 municipal governments, six national government agencies, and three NGOs.

Climate Risk Profile: Philippines The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including sea level rise, increased frequency of extreme weather events, rising temperatures and extreme rainfall due to its high exposure to natural hazards (cyclones, landslides, floods, droughts), dependence on climate-sensitive natural resources and vast coastlines. The Philippines lies in the world's most cyclone-prone region, averaging 19-20 cyclones each year, of which 7-9 make landfall as a result, sea levels in the Philippines are rising faster than the global average, increasing the hazard posed by storm surges and threatening permanent inundation of low-lying areas. A rich yet increasingly depleted natural and marine resources base supports livelihoods through fisheries, agriculture, forestry, energy, mining and tourism and provides critical ecosystem services such as shoreline protection, flood control, soil stability and habitats for biodiversity. pasagot po ng maayos plss lang​</h2><br />

Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper.Forthwith Kadunong described the ancient land and spoke of its first hero, Baltog, a white Aryan, who had come from Boltavara (Bharata-varsha or India). He planted a linsa patch in Tondol (now in Kamalig) which, one night, was foraged by a giant wild boar (Tandayag). The furious Baltog chased the Tandayag, killed with his bare hands, and hung its enormous jawbones on a talisay tree in front of his house in Tondol. For this marvelous feat, he was acknowledged chief of the local hunters. The clans of Panicuason and Asog came over to marvel at the monstrous wild boar in Ibalong.Next to come was Handyong. With his followers, he fought the monsters of the land. But Oryol, a wily serpent who appeared as a beautiful maiden with a seductive voice, was one whom Handyong could not destroy. Meanwhile, Oryol admired Handyong’s bravery and gallantry. Because of this, Oryol helped Handyong clear the region of ferocious beasts until peace came to the land.With Ibalong rid of wild creatures, Handyong turned to making wise laws and planting the land with linsa and rice. A period of the invention followed: boat, farming tools, weaving looms, clay wares, kitchen utensils, tree houses, and even a syllabary. Together, the people built a society with culture. It was a golden period in Ibalong when even slaves were respected under the laws of Handyong.Then came a great flood, freed by Unos, that changed the features of the land. Three volcanoes, named Hantik, Kulasi and Isarog erupted simultaneously. Inundations caused lands to sink, from which Lake Buhi came about, or rise, as in the strip of seacoast in Pasacao, Camarines Sur, and wiped out many settlements, especially the Dagatnong settlement in the Kalabanga Gulf. The Malbogong Islet mountain sank in Bato, forming a lake.Despite the calamities, Ibalong grew powerful under Old Chief Handyong, whose constant companion and good friend, by then, was the young Bantong.Although given a thousand men to destroy the half man and half beast Rabot, who could change enemies into rocks, Bantong slew it single-handedly – to the loudcheers of these thousand warriors that reverberated throughout the forests and mangrove swamps. Brought Ligmanan, the corpse of Rabot was horrible to behold that the Great Handyong himself was shocked at the sight.1. What is the selection about?2.

                            28. Performance Task 2 Cite evidence to support general statement. Direction: With the recent earthquakes that happened in Turkey and Syria, people started to realize the importance of disaster-preparedness. Read the news article given below and cite evidence using the sentence prompters below. The Philippines is among the topmost vulnerable countries in the world to natural disasters and climate impacts. Last year, the country experienced a volcanic eruption, a series of major earthquakes, and successive typhoons that inundated more than 60 towns and cities. Knowing the country's vulnerability level to disasters, various government agencies rolled out a series of apps to aid local government officials in crafting local solutions to these disasters. These solutions are based on the National Exposure Database (NED), a platform that collates data to aid in policymaking. For the Philippines, the COVID-19 pandemic wasn't the only disaster to hit the country in 2020. The year started out with a volcanic eruption and closed with two magnitude 6 earthquakes, one of them striking on Christmas morning. In between came Typhoon Goni, a late-season superstorm that was the strongest in the world last year. At least 60% of the country's total land area, nearly 300,000 square kilometers (116,000 square miles), is vulnerable to natural hazards, in large part due to the archipelago's location along both the path of the tropical storms brewing in the western Pacific and the Ring of Fire. Around 74% of its population of more than 100 million is subject to various impacts from these disasters, and the country routinely ranks among the top 10 natural disaster-prone countries in the world, according to the World Risk Index. Mitigation efforts depend on a network of early-warning systems that are constantly being fine-tuned, and on establishing mechanisms to respond more quickly to natural disasters. The latest shot of help comes from the National Exposure Database (NED), which identifies vulnerable areas so agencies and local governments can come up with real-time analyses and craft swift responses during a disaster. It also helps in planning and implementing disaster-ready solutions. The NED's primary tool for data collection and updates is GeoMapperPH, a web and mobile application that collates hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and coping capacity data from across the country. Launched last July, GeoMapperPH was developed by various government agencies led by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS). Built around a geographic information system (GIS) core, it aids in disaster prevention and mitigation by tapping the databases of at least 53 municipal governments, six national government agencies, and three NGOs.
