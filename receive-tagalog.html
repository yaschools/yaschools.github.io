                                            14. Ano ang tagalog ng Kelly had a job in a grocery store, but it didn't pay very much and she was sick of working there. Nonetheless, the work was steady and she needed all of the money that she could get. To her delight, Kelly got an interview at a big office in Tandag City for a job that paid much more. The interview went very well and the bosses all but offered her a position. They said that she would fit the role well and they promised that they would call her back within two weeks. Kelly couldn't wait to quit her job. As soon as she got back she quit her work in the store. She spent the next two weeks bragging to her coworkers about her new high-paying job in Tandag City. Yet, two weeks passed and she received no phone call. When Kelly decided to follow up on her interview, she learned that the bosses had chosen a different candidate. Kelly was crushed.​</a>

ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project will provide food for 55.000 low-income families, informal settlers, and families who have lost their livelihoods due to the COVID-19 pandemic. An initial 55,000 poor households affected by COVID-19 will receive a bag of rice, and canned goods from ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project. ADB has launched an emergency food provision program on 31 March, following the approval of the $5 million Rapid Emergency Supplies Provision technical assistance program. The grant is implemented under the Tagalog name Bayan Bayanihan, the well-known Filipino principle of sharing what one has with one's community.The program provides for essential food supplies to around 55,000 of the most vulnerable households in the National Capital Region and neighboring areas, affected by income losses for daily wage earners due to the enhanced quarantine to contain COVID-19. It will act as a 'bridge' support until ADB's large-scale cash transfer program is rolled out. The program has a collaboration platform to attract private sector and philanthropic contributions for its expansion.1. What is the newsflash about?2.

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</a>

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</a>

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

                            8. 14. Ano ang tagalog ng Kelly had a job in a grocery store, but it didn't pay very much and she was sick of working there. Nonetheless, the work was steady and she needed all of the money that she could get. To her delight, Kelly got an interview at a big office in Tandag City for a job that paid much more. The interview went very well and the bosses all but offered her a position. They said that she would fit the role well and they promised that they would call her back within two weeks. Kelly couldn't wait to quit her job. As soon as she got back she quit her work in the store. She spent the next two weeks bragging to her coworkers about her new high-paying job in Tandag City. Yet, two weeks passed and she received no phone call. When Kelly decided to follow up on her interview, she learned that the bosses had chosen a different candidate. Kelly was crushed.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Si Kelly ay may trabaho sa isang grocery store, ngunit ito ay hindi gaanong binayaran at siya ay may sakit na magtrabaho doon. Gayunpaman, ang trabaho ay hindi nagbabago at kailangan niya ang lahat ng pera na makukuha niya. Sa kanyang tuwa, nagpa-interview si Kelly sa isang malaking opisina sa Tandag City para sa trabahong mas malaki ang sahod. Ang panayam ay naging napakahusay at ang mga amo ay nag-alok sa kanya ng isang posisyon. Babagay daw siya sa role at nangako silang tatawagan siya ulit within two weeks. Hindi na makapaghintay si Kelly na huminto sa kanyang trabaho. Pagbalik niya ay huminto siya sa kanyang trabaho sa tindahan. Ginugol niya ang sumunod na dalawang linggo sa pagyayabang sa kanyang mga katrabaho tungkol sa kanyang bagong trabahong may mataas na suweldo sa Tandag City. Gayunpaman, lumipas ang dalawang linggo at wala siyang natanggap na tawag sa telepono.

                            9. Emergency COVID-19 Food Supply Program Launched in the Philippines' Capital Food for 55.000 vulnerable COVID-19-affected families in Metro Manila will be provided through ADB's $5 million Bayan Bayanihan project. ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project will provide food for 55.000 low-income families, informal settlers, and families who have lost their livelihoods due to the COVID-19 pandemic. An initial 55,000 poor households affected by COVID-19 will receive a bag of rice, and canned goods from ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project. ADB has launched an emergency food provision program on 31 March, following the approval of the $5 million Rapid Emergency Supplies Provision technical assistance program. The grant is implemented under the Tagalog name Bayan Bayanihan, the well-known Filipino principle of sharing what one has with one's community.The program provides for essential food supplies to around 55,000 of the most vulnerable households in the National Capital Region and neighboring areas, affected by income losses for daily wage earners due to the enhanced quarantine to contain COVID-19. It will act as a 'bridge' support until ADB's large-scale cash transfer program is rolled out. The program has a collaboration platform to attract private sector and philanthropic contributions for its expansion.1. What is the newsflash about?2.

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</h2><br />

Ang mga mag-aaral ay may maraming mga pagpipilian pagdating sa pagtanggap ng hindi etikal na tulong sa kapaligiran sa klase sa online.  Binanggit ni Rowe (2010) ang tatlong karaniwang pamamaraan na ginamit ng mga estudyante upang manloko sa mga kurso sa online.  Naghihintay ang mga mag-aaral na kunin ang kanilang pagtatasa upang makakuha sila ng mga sagot mula sa iba, muling kunin ng mga mag-aaral ang mga pagtatasa batay sa maling mga pag-angkin at ang mga mag-aaral ay nakatanggap ng hindi pinahihintulutang tulong sa panahon ng mga pagsusulit (Rowe, 2010).

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</h2><br />
                        <p>Ang isang pagtaas ng problema ng labis na pag-aalala para sa mga institusyong pang-akademiko ay ang paglaganap ng pandaraya sa mga mag-aaral. Ang karagdagang pagsasama-sama sa problemang ito ay mga pagsulong sa teknolohiya na lumikha ng mga bagong paraan para sa mga mag-aaral na makisali sa pandaraya. Sa kabila ng lumalaking interes sa pandaraya na pinadali ng teknolohiya, kaunti ang nalalaman tungkol sa kung bakit maaaring gumamit ang mga mag-aaral ng elektronikong mapagkukunan upang manloko. Gayunpaman, nag-aalok ang teorya ng panlipunan ng pagkatuto ni Akers ng isang makatuwirang paliwanag. Ang mga survey ay nakolekta mula sa isang sample ng 534 mga mag-aaral sa kolehiyo sa isang malaking timog-silangan na unibersidad upang masukat ang pagkalat at dalas ng pandaraya na pinadali ng Internet. Pinapayagan ng mga survey na ito ang isang paggalugad ng mga salik na nauugnay sa ganitong uri ng pandaraya at isang paghahambing sa pagitan ng tinutukoy namin bilang E-cheating at tradisyunal na mga paraan ng pandaraya. Ipinapahiwatig ng mga resulta na humigit-kumulang na 40% ng mga mag-aaral ang nakatuon sa ilang anyo ng E-cheating sa nakaraang taon. Ang mga variable ng pagkatuto sa lipunan ay lumalabas bilang pinakamalakas na tagahula ng parehong paglitaw at dalas ng E-cheating habang ang mga variable ng pagpipigil sa sarili at pilay ay may maliit na epekto.</p><br />

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

Answer the following questions:
1. What message does the lyricist, Levi Celerio, convey in his song?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>ctto:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>the famous filipino folk song "ang pipit" has a sad story. if we will try to interpet the lyrics literally, it talks about a bird who was hit by a stone. the poor creature was unable to fly because of the pain and the severity of the injury so it fell from the tree. but before it hit the ground, it expresses its worry that another bird will be sad by the former's demise and that the man was too cruel for taking an innocent living being's life.
