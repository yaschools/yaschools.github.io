So, when Paul wrote 1 Corinthians, he didn't first sit down and pray and say, "Lord, inspire me to write 1 Corinthians," he just wrote a letter to the Corinthians. And yet, in that process, the Spirit was working in the mind of Paul so that 1 Corinthians is not only a letter to a first century church, but is revelation to the people of God.</p><p></p><br />

To those of you who are brand-new to Ricks College, we welcome you. To those of you who are returning, welcome back. We note with sadness that yesterday three of our students were involved in a tragic accident in Thayne, Wyoming. Two of the students were injured, and the life of one was taken. We express our condolences and love to the families and pray for the speedy recovery of those who were injured. </p><p>Since assuming my responsibilities as the president of Ricks College last summer, one of my points of emphasis has been the study and use of the scriptures. Those of you who are new to Ricks will note that at the beginning of today's devotional assembly, Brother Bird asked you to hold up your scriptures. This is a new tradition we started at our first devotional last fall, and it is a tradition through which we will continue to encourage all students and faculty to consistently study and use the scriptures. As I am sure most of you recognize, the real significance of this tradition is not merely bringing and holding up your scriptures every Tuesday in devotional. Rather, this simple act is but a reminder and symbol of our collective appreciation for, desire to learn from, and commitment to consistently and conscientiously study the holy scriptures. </p><p>Today I hope to accomplish two objectives as I visit with you: (1) provide a doctrinal foundation for understanding the importance of studying the scriptures and (2) emphasize basic principles that can help each of us become more effective in our personal study of the scriptures. I pray for, I yearn for, and I invite the Spirit of the Lord to be with each of us today, that we may understand each other and truly be edified. </p><p>I am going to refer to a number of scriptures--many more than we could possibly look up and read together in the allotted devotional time. Some of the references I will specifically ask you to look up in your scriptures and read along with me; other verses I will quote directly and provide only the reference. You may find it helpful to jot down the references and study the quoted verses in more detail at a later time. </p><p>Prophets, church leaders, advisors, teachers, and parents all talk and teach about the importance of studying the scriptures. Why is studying the scriptures so important? May I suggest three answers: </p><p>• Studying the scriptures is important because of the covenants we have made. </p><p>• Studying the scriptures is important because of the direction we need in our lives. </p><p>• Studying the scriptures is important because scripture study is a preparation for and prerequisite to receiving personal revelation.  </p><p>  </p><p>Those three answers can be summarized in the following words: covenants, direction, and revelation. Those are three doctrinal reasons why studying the scriptures is so important. </p><p>A covenant is an agreement between God and his children here upon the earth. God sets the conditions of the covenant, and there are promised blessings. As we are obedient to the conditions of the covenant, we receive the promised blessings. Verse 77 in Section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants outlines the three specific covenants we make at the time we enter the waters of baptism. We hear this prayer and are reminded of the covenants each Sunday as we partake of the emblems of the sacrament. </p><p>O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen. (D&amp;C 20:77, emphasis added) </p><p>The three conditions are that we (1) take upon us the name of Christ, (2) always remember him, and (3) keep the commandments. The promised blessing is that we will always have his Spirit to be with us. </p><p>I want to draw your attention to the second covenantal obligation to "always remember him." I do not know of a better way to always remember him than to daily study the scriptures. That covenant is not an abstract notion. It can be honored in meaningful, personal prayer every morning and night and in diligent study of the scriptures. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Someone quietly joined their walk and asked what they were discussing. They didn’t recognize his voice as he “opened the Scriptures” to them. Upon arriving home, they invited him to come in and stay with them. Then their guest turned the tables on them, taking on the role of host as they began their supper. He thanked God for the bread, broke it, and served it as he had often done for his disciples. Suddenly they saw that their “guest” was the risen Christ—and he disappeared!</p><p></p><p>They knew they had to do something. So immediately they returned to Jerusalem to tell the disciples, to share the good news they had burning in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>When I became a believer in Christ, my heart was aflame with newfound faith.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are 4 main scriptural images of the church. Each of them helps us understand the CHURCH and its PURPOSE to our lives. This are the following:</p><strong>Flock of Christ, the Good Shepherd who lays down his life for his Sheep</strong><strong>Vineyard of God</strong><strong>Temple of God with Christ as the Cornerstone</strong><strong>Our Mother, the spotless spouse of the spotless lamb</strong><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Since these images are drawn from specific images of the biblical people, they have to be explained for further understanding on their importance.</p><strong>Flock of Christ, the Good Shepherd who lays down his life for his Sheep</strong><p>In this scriptural image, it is shown that we, the church (the people) are God's sheep. As he tend his sheep (us), he was so caring and loving that he'd always felt afraid that any sheep might get lost. Just like us, as we are sent in this world, God continues to oversee us and help us out of negative situations which might lead us to wrong doings. However, as a flock of sheep, we tend to go out of the way. Despite our wrongdoings and our want to stay out of the flock, God never let go of us. He protected us that he even gave up his life to redeem our sins. With the redemption, we were saved and forever we our in debt to God for this unconditional favor.</p><strong>Vineyard of God</strong><p>"I am the God and you are the branches". We the church is the vineyard of God. We are his followers and he is the leader. In every step he make, it is right that we must follow it and continue to walk on his path.</p><strong>Temple of God with Christ as the Cornerstone</strong><p>Our church is the temple of God. It is built through his love and passion to care for us. Without him as the foundation, we wouldn't be able to continue our church. We will be broken and everything will fall apart. It is founded on his mercy and our faith.</p><strong>Our Mother, the spotless spouse of the spotless lamb</strong><p>This refers to the "Jerusalem which is above and our Mother". It is the church that made Jesus decide to end his human life to sanctify her. It is the one that God cherishes and loves forever with unbroken alliance.</p><p></p><p>For more understanding, please read more about Church:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/480034</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

                            17. What do we mean by Canon of Scriptures?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The expression “Bible canon” came to denote the collection, or list, of books accepted as genuine inspired Scripture.
</p><p>
</p><p>The term “canon” is derived from the Hebrew word qa·nehʹ (reed). Reeds were used as a rule or measuring device. (Eze 41:8) Fittingly, the Bible canon, or catalog of inspired books, enables the reader to “measure” faith, doctrine, and conduct.
</p><p>
</p><p>The canon of the Hebrew Scriptures was established by the end of the fifth century B.C.E. According to Jewish tradition, the skilled scribe and inspired Bible writer Ezra began the work, and it was completed by Nehemiah. (Ezr 7:6, ftn.) The writing of the Christian Greek Scriptures was completed during the time that the gifts of the spirit were operative on Christ’s followers. (Joh 14:26; Re 1:1) Some Christians had the gift of “discernment of inspired expressions.” (1Co 12:10) Thus, they could, without referring the matter to a supposed church council, determine which of the letters the congregation received were inspired of God. With the death of John, the last apostle, this reliable chain of divinely inspired men came to an end. Therefore, with the book of Revelation, John’s Gospel, and his three letters, the Bible canon was closed. The testimony of later, noninspired writers is valuable only as an acknowledgment of the Bible canon, which God’s spirit had guided and authorized.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

From dreams that depict strange prophecies given by God to his prophets that make no sense at all, angels of all sorts and forms with hybrid images, and events that could not have been mapped out visually, images really help depict what the Church means to convey. Images in cathedrals that show the important events in Scriptural History such as the Birth of Jesus gives the believers a message of hope and joy that God still waits for us to change and believe once more. Another image like the Passion of Christ in Churches shows that even if we face the hardest challenges, we should never fail to see Jesus' death for His love for his people and the death of sin that he alone faced that we can truly say was the hardest challenge of all history, meaning that through the word IMPOSSIBLE, we see "POSSIBLE".</strong></p><br />

                            30. What is the meaning of writing the scriptural images of the church depicted from the passage John 10:1-6​</h2><br />
                        <p>John 10:1-6 is a parable about the Good Shepherd. Jesus is the Good Shepherd. The interpretation of the parable is given to us by Jesus Himself in John 10:7-16. The “shepherd of the sheep” in this illustration is Jesus Christ (John 10:11) and any other person is a robber or thief (John 10:7-8). He is the door and the shepherd (John 10:7, 11); Jesus is the way to eternal life and He is the One who keeps us. Jesus is the Good Shepherd for two more reasons. First, He was the predicted and promised Messiah and King (Isaiah 7:14; 11:1; 9:6; Daniel 9:25-27; Luke 1:32). No one else qualifies. No one else is the true Messiah or future King of the entire world.</p><p>Second, Jesus is referred to as a shepherd throughout the New Testament (Matthew 2:6; Hebrews 13:20-21; 1 Peter 2:25; 5:4; Revelation 7:17). As we have already said, Jesus says that He is the Good Shepherd (John 10:11). The sheep are those who believe in Jesus Christ (John 10:9, 16, 27-28) and as a result know the voice of the true shepherd and will not follow another (John 10:27-28). Those who follow anyone other than Jesus Christ are not the sheep in this parable (John 10:26). Those who truly belong to God will follow Jesus Christ and no other (John 10:14). Jesus is the Good Shepherd because He was willing to and did die for all those who believe in Him – His sheep (John 10:17-18). The message of this parable is that Jesus is the true shepherd. Jesus is the Good Shepherd who was willing to die and did die for those who put their faith in Him. Any other person who claims to be the true shepherd is a robber or thief. he or she is a false shepherd. This was a powerful message to the Jewish religious leaders who considered themselves to be the true shepherds of God’s flock. This is a wonderful message for anyone who seeks peace with God and security in eternity. Jesus is the Door to eternal salvation and Jesus is the Good Shepherd who cares, watches, and protects those who believe in Him.</p><p></p><br />
