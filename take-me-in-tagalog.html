Ez Mil
Like they said though:
You can take a man out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the man
Mga kababayan, turn up!
Tayo ay Pilipino
Kahit anong kulay ng balat
Isasapuso
Mapa-Tagalog, Bisaya, o Ilokano
Walang tatalo sa bagsik
Ng ating dugo
Isigaw ng malakas ang
Ating panalo
Wag nang pagusapan
Ang mga negatibong pangyayari
San mang panig ka
Nasa mundo
Kinabukasan na natin 'to
Panalo!
Yeah
Keep runnin' ya mouth when you lyin'
I stay on my business while watchin' you dyin'
I'm takin' my people to heights while you cryin'
Bout regular livin' &amp; that's what I'm tryna
Prove, 'stead of just lyin' in booths
First true Filipino rapper on the news
Sit, enjoy it if ya' cool
Haters can snooze
While I put my city on the map
22-double the Olongapo City no cap
Never forgettin' the street where my
Cousin would sit when we always just listen to rap
Kendrick, Em, &amp; A$AP with some metal
And man we would turn up with that
Been mundane till the sun came
Now I want fame like a kid in the trap uh
Aye
I been in Spain (Spain)
But the letter 'S' is silent (pain)
I'm claimin' my reign like a king
So I can water crops for survivin' (rain rain)
Go away if you trippin' (yuh)
Had a homie he was Cripn' (cuh)
Ain't got no love for the people
Who talk over songs when they
Claimin' they listen (listen listen)
These bars - never done, uh
3 stars and a sun, aye
Blue, red draped down on a flag
No we never fear none
Most of us didn't grow up with a trust fund
Know that I'm willin' to kill for a loved one
I'm on the move from a nothin' to someone
Reminding my people to shout:
Tayo ay Pilipino
Kahit anong kulay ng balat
Isasapuso
Mapa-Tagalog, Bisaya, o Ilokano
Walang tatalo sa bagsik

Isigaw ng malakas ang
Ating panalo
Wag nang pagusapan
Ang mga negatibong pangyayari
San mang panig ka
Nasa mundo
Kinabukasan na natin to, (Lam mo na.)
(Woo!) Panalo!
Aye
Huh, aye
Kung inakala mong isang lenggwahe
Lang kayang gamitin ni Ez Mil
La kang mapapala kung ganyan ka
Magisip kay Bathala ka sisingil;
Utang na galing sa loob na
Lumutang, hinain sa turon na may
Pusang sinaing sa-
(Mag ilokano ka tol!)
Ano?
(Ilokano!, Ilokano)
Okay!

Ever since bata ako I've been kinda
Discriminated in my own home country
Sure, some would be like:
"LuH AmPuTi pUTi mO . tiSoY"

And I swear that:
NOBODY WILL EVER LOOK AT ME THE
SAME WAY AGAIN
I'LL MAKE IT TO THE TOP WHILE I BE SHOWIN'

'Stead of just lyin' in booths
First true Filipino rapper on the news
Sit, enjoy it if ya' cool
Haters can snooze
While I put my city on the map

Never forgettin' the street where my cousin would sit
When we always just listen to rap
Kendrick, Em, &amp; A$AP with some metal
And man we would turn up with that
Been mundane till the sun came
Now I want fame like a kid in the trap uh
Aye
I been in Spain (Spain)
But the letter 'S' is silent (pain)
I'm claimin' my reign like a king
So I can water crops for survivin' (rain rain)
Go away if you trippin' (yuh)
Had a homie he was crippin' (cuh)
Ain't got no love for the people
Who talk over songs when they
Claimin' they listen (listen listen)
These bars never done, uh
3 stars and a sun, aye
Blue, red draped down on a flag
No we never fear none
Most of us didn't grow up with a trust fund
Know that I'm willin' to kill for a loved one
I'm on the move from a nothin' to someone
Reminding my people to shout

I adore everything about you because you're more than just a friend to me; you're also my best friend and a bro.</a>

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </a>

Never forgettin' the street where my
Cousin would sit when we always just listen to rap
Kendrick, Em, &amp; A$AP with some metal
And man we would turn up with that
Been mundane till the sun came
Now I want fame like a kid in the trap uh

But the letter 'S' is silent (pain)
I'm claimin' my reign like a king
So I can water crops for survivin' (rain rain)
Go away if you trippin' (yuh)
Had a homie he was Cripn' (cuh)
Ain't got no love for the people
Who talk over songs when they
Claimin' they listen (listen listen)
These bars - never done, uh
3 stars and a sun, aye
Blue, red draped down on a flag
No we never fear none
Most of us didn't grow up with a trust fund
Know that I'm willin' to kill for a loved one
I'm on the move from a nothin' to someone
Reminding my people to shout:

It entails taking an interest in one another's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Friendships are built on trust, respect, emotional support, and admiration. Life's too short to waste your days with someone who make you feel unworthy and unappreciated. Spend it with friends who makes you laugh and feel loved.

Like they said though
You can take a man out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the man
Mga kababayan, turn up!
Tayo'y Pilipino
Kahit anong kulay ng balat, isasapuso
Mapa-Tagalog, Bisaya, o Ilokano
Walang tatalo sa bagsik ng ating dugo
Isigaw ng malakas ang ating panalo
'Wag nang pagusapan ang mga negatibong pangyayari
Sa'n mang panig ka nasa mundo
Kinabukasan na natin 'to, panalo!
Yeah
Keep runnin' ya mouth when you lyin'
I stay on my business while watchin' you dyin'
I'm takin' my people to heights while you cryin'
'Bout regular livin' &amp; that's what I'm tryna prove
'Stead of just lyin' in booths
First true Filipino rapper on the news
Sit, enjoy it if ya' cool
Haters can snooze
While I put my city on the map
22-double the Olongapo City no cap
Never forgettin' the street where my cousin would sit
When we always just listen to rap
Kendrick, Em, &amp; A$AP with some metal
And man we would turn up with that
Been mundane till the sun came
Now I want fame like a kid in the trap uh
Aye
I been in Spain (Spain)
But the letter 'S' is silent (pain)
I'm claimin' my reign like a king
So I can water crops for survivin' (rain rain)
Go away if you trippin' (yuh)
Had a homie he was crippin' (cuh)
Ain't got no love for the people
Who talk over songs when they
Claimin' they listen (listen listen)
These bars never done, uh
3 stars and a sun, aye
Blue, red draped down on a flag
No we never fear none
Most of us didn't grow up with a trust fund
Know that I'm willin' to kill for a loved one
I'm on the move from a nothin' to someone
Reminding my people to shout
Tayo'y Pilipino
Kahit anong kulay ng balat isasapuso
Mapa-Tagalog, Bisaya, o Ilokano
Walang tatalo sa bagsik ng ating dugo

Aye
Huh, aye

'La kang mapapala kung ganyan ka magisip
Kay Bathala ka sisingil
Utang na galing sa loob na lumutang
Hinain sa turon na may pusang sinaing sa-
(Mag-ilokano ka tol!) ano?
(Ilokano, Ilokano) okay!

Ever since bata ako I've been kinda
Discriminated in my own home country
Sure, some would be like:
"Luh ang puti puti mo, tisoy"
I ain't tisoy, I'm Pinoy
And I swear that:
Nobody will ever look at me the same way again
I'll make it to the top while I be showin'

Nanalo na ako nung una pa na pinugutan si Lapu sa Mactan
At lahat ang nasaktan na nalaman nila na pinatay
Ang kanilang bayani sa karagatan ng bansa na pag-aari ng Pilipino
Despite any termoil
I'll be proud of my soil
Bakit?

                            18. Tagalog meaning of Friendships are ties formed by two or more people who want to interact with one other. It entails taking an interest in one another's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Friendships are built on trust, respect, emotional support, and admiration. Life's too short to waste your days with someone who make you feel unworthy and unappreciated. Spend it with friends who makes you laugh and feel loved.
I hope you understand how much having you in my life means to me. You have made my problems lighter and my life better. You've been there when the weather was good and stood with me in the rain, you've laughed with me in the good times and the bad, and you've even shared my sorrow.

yes or no? why?

Give me a good reason abt your answer. Habaan nio, take your time writing a reason!^^</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:Yes</p><p>Well, in a sense, God gives me second chances every day. He’s given me new life and a chance to live it to serve him. And he forgives me for sinning and messing up when he has every right to take that life away.</p><p></p><p>But I assume you mean if I could go back in time and redo some part of my life.</p><p></p><p>While there are many things I would love to change, I would be very hesitant to do so. Why? Because I have no idea what effect that would have on the rest of me or on the world as a whole. Have you heard of the butterfly effect? The idea behind it is basically that every single occurrence, no matter how small, works together with all the other tiny occurrences to produce various effects. The slightest change in any one of those occurrences could result in a totally different effect. So a single butterfly flapping its wings in South Africa, and the tiny change that makes in the surrounding air, could be the difference between a hurricane in Florida and a gentle breeze, based on its interaction over time with all the other tiny changes in the air.</p><p></p><p>The same principle, I think, would apply to my own actions. If I changed something I did in 2008, even something small, it could result in a disastrous effect on other people around me and on myself. It could also change things for the better. But since I believe God is in control and has directed or permitted things in my life — whether my own actions or the actions of others — that will shape me into the person he wants me to be, I do not think I would want to override that. So ultimately, though there are many things I would want to change, I think I would ultimately choose not to change them.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Hope it helps po :))</p><p>Pa brainliest nman pow! :D</p><br />

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Noong unang panahon, ang mga diyos lamang ang nabubuhay sa mundong ito, ang lupa, dagat, at langit ay pinamumunuan ng tatlong magkakaibang</p><p>makapangyarihang mga diyos. Ang diyos ng araw, na namuno sa langit, ay may isang napakagandang anak na babae, si Luna, ang buwan. Nag-enjoy si Luna</p><p>umiikot sa langit sakay ng kanyang gintong karo. Isang araw natagpuan niya ang kanyang sarili na tumahak sa ibang landas na humantong</p><p>sa labas ng kanyang kaharian. Naglakad-lakad siya hanggang sa marating niya ang lugar kung saan sinalubong ng langit ang dagat Maganda</p><p>at hindi pangkaraniwang tanawin ang sumalubong sa kanyang mga mata.</p><p>Habang hinahangaan niya ang mga magagandang bagay sa paligid, isang boses ang bumulaga sa kanya. Nagtanong ito, “Saan ka pupunta</p><p>galing sa pinaka maganda?" Paglingon niya ay nakita niya ang isang binata na kamukha ng kanyang ama</p><p>mas patas. Gusto niyang tumakas, ngunit nang muli siyang tumingin sa kanya, nakita niyang nakangiti ito sa kanya. Pagkuha</p><p>lakas ng loob niyang sumagot, "Ako si Luna, anak ng diyos ng araw." Ngumiti sa kanya ang binata at sumagot, “I</p><p>Ako si Mar, ang anak ng diyos ng dagat. Maligayang pagdating sa aming kaharian." Hindi nagtagal ay naging matalik na magkaibigan ang dalawa. Marami silang kawili-wiling kwento na sasabihin. Kapag oras na para sa</p><p>Luna to go, nangakong magkikita sila nang madalas hangga't maaari, dahil marami pa silang kwento sila</p><p>Nagpatuloy ang pagkikita sa iisang lugar hanggang sa napagtanto nilang in love na sila sa isa't isa.</p><p>Isang araw pagkatapos ng isa sa kanilang mga lihim na pagkikita, bumalik si Luna sa langit na puno ng kagalakan. Siya ay gayon</p><p>masaya na sinabi niya ang sikreto niya sa isa niyang pinsan. Ang pinsan, naninibugho sa kanyang kagandahan at kanyang kaligayahan, iniulat ang relasyon sa diyos ng araw. Nagalit ang diyos ng araw sa pagsuway ng kanyang anak sa imortal</p><p>mga batas. Isinara niya siya sa kanilang hardin at hindi siya pinayagang makalabas. Pagkatapos ay umuwi siyang malungkot. Sa tuwing naaalala niya si Mar, nagmamadali siyang lumabas sa ginto</p><p>kalesa patungo sa tagpuan sa pag-asang makita siyang muli. Ang mga mangingisda sa labas ng dagat ay naniniwala na sa bawat oras</p><p>Lumilitaw si Luna, ang buwan, nagugulo ang dagat. Si Mar ang sumusubok na tumakas sa kanyang kweba,” sabi nila.</p><br />
