                                            Warden was charged with negligence after he failed to prevent the escape of some prisoners. He came up with an alibi: He was escorting the prisoners back from the courtroom when one of them threatened to shoot if they were not released. The inmate happened to have a gun that was secretly given to him by an accomplice while the hearing was going on. The warden was taking all the precautions in accordance with their operations manual, but he was not ready for the gun. The prisoner threatened to kill him if he did not unlock their handcuffs. Since there was no one else around in that secluded part of the road, the lone warden could not call for help. He saved his life by releasing the culprits. He tried his best to convince the prisoners not to proceed with their escape, but he did not succeed. He waited for an opportunity to grab the bun but that never came. IS HE MORALLY RESPONSIBLE?

                            1. what is the antonym of accomplice​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>accomplice. Antonyms : rival, foe adversary, antagonist Synonyms : abettor, confederate accessory ally associate. partner, colleague coadjutor. assistant, particips criminit '</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>English Synonyms and Antonyms</p><p>accomplice</p><p></p><p>Colleague is used always in a good sense, associate and coadjutor generally so; ally, assistant, associate, attendant, companion, helper, either in a good or a bad sense; abetter, accessory, accomplice, confederate, almost always in a bad sense. Ally is oftenest used of national and military matters, or of some other connection regarded as great and important; as, allies of despotism. Colleague is applied to civil and ecclesiastical connections; members of Congress from the same State are colleagues, even though they may be bitter opponents politically and personally. An Associate Justice of the Supreme Court is near in rank to the Chief Justice. A surgeon's assistant is a physician or medical student who shares in the treatment and care of patients; a surgeon's attendant is one who rolls bandages and the like. Follower, henchman, retainer are persons especially devoted to a chief, and generally bound to him by necessity, fee, or reward. Partner has come to denote almost exclusively a business connection. In law, an abettor (the general legal spelling) is always present, either actively or constructively, at the commission of the crime; an accessory never. An accomplice is usually a principal; an accessory never. If present, though only to stand outside and keep watch against surprise, one is an abettor, and not an accessory. At common law, an accessory implies a principal, and can not be convicted until after the conviction of the principal; the accomplice or abettor can be convicted as a principal. Accomplice and abettor have nearly the same meaning, but the former is the popular, the latter more distinctively the legal term.

                            20. defferentiate the Principles vs Accomplices vs Accesory​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sometimes a crime may only involve one perpetrator. However, in many serious crimes, there will be multiple parties that contribute to pulling off the offense. A principal in a crime is the one who pulls the trigger in a murder, brandishes a knife during a bank robbery, or commits the actual criminal act.  </p><p>
</p><p>Two other common designations for people involved in crimes are accomplices and accessories. Sometimes, whether or not someone is charged as one of those and not the other can mean decades in prison. Therefore, it’s important to understand the differences between the two.  </p><p>
</p><p>What Is an Accomplice?
</p><p>
</p><p>Accomplices (commonly called aiders and abettors) are more connected to the crime itself than accessories and are therefore usually subject to harsher penalties. The key difference between accessories and accomplices is that accessories are not present at the crime scene, while accomplices are present and usually have an integral part in the criminal act. Sometimes, depending on the extent to which someone contributes to a crime, an accomplice will be designated as a “principal in the second degree.” In that vein, many states will seek to punish accomplices to the same extent as the first-degree principal. Even if the main principle goes to trial and is found not guilty, the accomplice could still be tried as a principal.
</p><p>
</p><p>What Is an Accessory?
</p><p>
</p><p>Accessories are usually people who cover up the crime after it has been committed. A common designation you may have heard is someone being charged as an “accessory after the fact.” This can mean hiding stolen money or providing safe harbor to the principal or accomplices to avoid capture by the authorities. “Accessories before the fact” do exist, but states will often seek to prosecute them as accomplices.
</p><p>
</p><p>Common Purpose Doctrine
</p><p>
</p><p>As with many criminal cases, intent is important in determining someone’s culpability. The Common Purpose doctrine exists to clarify criminal roles in these situations. If someone helps with the planning of a bank robbery, for example, with the intention of contributing to a successful heist, then they are considered an accomplice. If the authorities do not think they can prove an accomplice had prior knowledge of a crime, they will often seek to prosecute the defendant as an accessory.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            25. Warden was charged with negligence after he failed to prevent the escape of some prisoners. He came up with an alibi: He was escorting the prisoners back from the courtroom when one of them threatened to shoot if they were not released. The inmate happened to have a gun that was secretly given to him by an accomplice while the hearing was going on. The warden was taking all the precautions in accordance with their operations manual, but he was not ready for the gun. The prisoner threatened to kill him if he did not unlock their handcuffs. Since there was no one else around in that secluded part of the road, the lone warden could not call for help. He saved his life by releasing the culprits. He tried his best to convince the prisoners not to proceed with their escape, but he did not succeed. He waited for an opportunity to grab the bun but that never came. IS HE MORALLY RESPONSIBLE? IF YOU WERE IN THE SITUATION, HOW WILL YOU HANDLE IT AND HOW WILL YOU EXERCISE YOUR FREEDOM RESPONSIBLY?introduction to philosophy of the human person yan po yung subject thank you! ​</h2><br />
