                                            The Philippines takes its unique social characteristics from three colonial influences thatvastly shaped local society and culture. Even until today, ev dences of Spanish, American,and Japanese colonialism flourish in every day Filipino living. For instance, many Fil pinosurnames were derived from Spanish origins. Filipinos are also relatively good Englishspeakers in comparison with other Southeast Asian nationalities. What other influenceshave our past left us?

                                            ACTIVITY 2 DIRECTIONS: Using the Venn diagram, compare and contrast Washington DC and London.Both Washington, DC, and London are capital cities of English-speaking countries, and yet they offer vastly different experiences to their residents and visitors. Comparing and contrasting the two cities based on their history, their culture, and their residents show how different and similar the two are. Both cities are rich in world and national history, though they developed on very different time lines. London, for example, has a history that dates back over two thousand years. It was part of the Roman Empire and known by the similar name, Londinium. It was not only one of the northernmost points of the Roman Em- pire but also the epicenter of the British Empire where it held significant global influence from the early sixteenth century on through the early twentieth century. Washington, DC, on the other hand, has only formally existed since the late eighteenth century. Though Native Americans inhabited the land several thousand years earlier, and settlers inhabited the land as early as the six- teenth century, the city did not become the capital of the United States until the 1790s. From that point onward to today, however, Washington, DC, has increasingly maintained significant global influence. Even though both cities have different histories, they have both held, and continue to hold, significant social influence in the economic and cultural global spheres.as well as a similar amount of global and national chains. While London may be better known for its pubs and taste in beer, DC offers a different bar-going experience. With clubs and pubs that tend to stay open later than their British counterparts, the DC night life tend to be less reserved overall. ​</a>

Given these vastly conflicting points of view, is it possible to arrive at a political consensus?
A political consensus is a reasoned judgment. It is solely based on politically prudent decisions, for instance, human welfare. It is difficult to proceed from the point of view of one's faith. But we can proceed from the point of view of certain non-negotiable moral values, i.e. the sanctity of human life, human dignity, and moral autonomy. For instance, given the country's Catholic tradition, the use of any human embryo from any donor,i.e. a pregnant woman, even with her consent, is unacceptable.</a>

                                            1.The death penalty does not deter crime. Since it is inequitable administered, capital punishment is unjust. Because it does not deter crime, because it is inequitably administered, and because it is unjust, the death penalty should be abandoned by civilized societies.2. Marijuana is less harmful to health than smoking is. The prejudices about social conditions that led to current marijuana legislation are outdated. Because the social conditions that give rise to current marijuana legislation no longer exist and because of the potential medical and financial benefits of its decriminalization, lawmakers should reconsider the legal status of cannabis3. Public School Performance in the United States has plummated over the past 20 years. It is unfair to force taxpayers to contribute to a school system that does not serve them. Following the Canadian System, Congress should form a system for public funding of religious schools for families opt out of the public school system.4. Violence on television influences children to behave violently. Although the financial benefit for networks is great, it is ultimately counterproductive to air violent television shows. Because violence on television is harmful to all strata of American society, strict guidelines for permissible content of television shows should be enacted5. Publicly funded art is the most expensive art in the world. Taxpayer funding for public art produces a low yield both physically and spiritually. Congress should discontinue funding for the organization since public art produces benefits that are vastly outweighed by its costFor every paragraph, identify the claim of fact, claim of value and claim of policy.Use the template below:Paragraph 1:Claim of Fact :Claim of Value:Claim of Policy:​</a>

                        In other terms, the question goes like this:<br />How are we speeding up the effects of the Competitive Exclusion Principle and thereby altering the outcome of that ecosystem's natural succession?<br />When the Ecosystem contains plants only, one species of plant out-competes the others and take over this illustrates the Competitive Exclusion Principle , which theorizes that no 2 species can occupy the same niche at same time particular location if resources are limited. The presence of humans or consumers is needed to keep that plant in check and allow the other specie to survive. <br />The producers are the harbingers of primary succession. As these pioneer plants die and decay, they add organic material to the soil, which allow a secondary succession.<br />

                            11. ACTIVITY 2 DIRECTIONS: Using the Venn diagram, compare and contrast Washington DC and London.Both Washington, DC, and London are capital cities of English-speaking countries, and yet they offer vastly different experiences to their residents and visitors. Comparing and contrasting the two cities based on their history, their culture, and their residents show how different and similar the two are. Both cities are rich in world and national history, though they developed on very different time lines. London, for example, has a history that dates back over two thousand years. It was part of the Roman Empire and known by the similar name, Londinium. It was not only one of the northernmost points of the Roman Em- pire but also the epicenter of the British Empire where it held significant global influence from the early sixteenth century on through the early twentieth century. Washington, DC, on the other hand, has only formally existed since the late eighteenth century. Though Native Americans inhabited the land several thousand years earlier, and settlers inhabited the land as early as the six- teenth century, the city did not become the capital of the United States until the 1790s. From that point onward to today, however, Washington, DC, has increasingly maintained significant global influence. Even though both cities have different histories, they have both held, and continue to hold, significant social influence in the economic and cultural global spheres.as well as a similar amount of global and national chains. While London may be better known for its pubs and taste in beer, DC offers a different bar-going experience. With clubs and pubs that tend to stay open later than their British counterparts, the DC night life tend to be less reserved overall. ​</h2><br />

                            13. Explain this pls. 
Given these vastly conflicting points of view, is it possible to arrive at a political consensus?
A political consensus is a reasoned judgment. It is solely based on politically prudent decisions, for instance, human welfare. It is difficult to proceed from the point of view of one's faith. But we can proceed from the point of view of certain non-negotiable moral values, i.e. the sanctity of human life, human dignity, and moral autonomy. For instance, given the country's Catholic tradition, the use of any human embryo from any donor,i.e. a pregnant woman, even with her consent, is unacceptable.</h2><br />

10. Triangle ABC is equiangular. Therefore each of its interior angles measures 60 degrees.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>6. Sometimes, in order to win, we need to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions. This was certainly the case in our battle against the enemy. By dividing our forces and attacking from two different directions, we were able to achieve victory.</p><p></p><p>7. Breath is the most essential function of life, and yet we often take it for granted. Every moment we are alive, we are breathing. And yet, how often do we stop to think about our breath? How often do we take the time to really notice the feeling of the air moving in and out of our lungs?</p><p>Breath is the foundation of life. Every creature on this earth needs to breathe in order to live. And yet, we humans often take our breath for granted. We go about our lives without giving much thought to the simple act of breathing. We take in air without really thinking about it, and we exhale without giving it much thought either.</p><p>But breath is so much more than just the act of taking in air and exhaling it. Breath is life. Breath is what keeps us alive. And yet, we often don't think about it. We go about our lives without giving it much thought.</p><p>But breath is also something that can be used to calm and relax the mind and body. When we are feeling stressed or anxious, one of the best things we can do is to focus on our breath. Taking a few deep breaths can help to calm and relax us.</p><p>So the next time you find yourself feeling stressed or anxious, take a moment to focus on your breath. Breathe in and out slowly and deeply. And remember, breath is life.</p><p></p><p>8. Understanding a document that is written in a language that I do not understand can be difficult, but there are a few methods that I use in order to try to understand it. By looking up words that I do not know in a dictionary and by trying to find a translation of the document, I am often able to understand the document better.</p><p></p><p>9. The US position on land mines is controversial, and there are a number of valid arguments on both sides. However, it is clear that the US has not yet been convinced that signing the treaty is in its best interests.</p><p></p><p>10. In conclusion, Triangle ABC is an equiangular triangle. This means that each of its interior angles measures 60 degrees. There are several interesting properties that are associated with equiangular triangles, such as the fact that they are always isosceles and always acute.</p><p></p><p><strong>NOTED: I'ts just a conclusion</strong></p><p></p><br />

As Walton stated, "but success shall crown my endeavors", just as Frankenstein said : "I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation."They are both curious and share a sense of seclusion. In his devotion to his studies, Frankenstein distances and isolates himself from his family and life in general.

                            30. 1.The death penalty does not deter crime. Since it is inequitable administered, capital punishment is unjust. Because it does not deter crime, because it is inequitably administered, and because it is unjust, the death penalty should be abandoned by civilized societies.2. Marijuana is less harmful to health than smoking is. The prejudices about social conditions that led to current marijuana legislation are outdated. Because the social conditions that give rise to current marijuana legislation no longer exist and because of the potential medical and financial benefits of its decriminalization, lawmakers should reconsider the legal status of cannabis3. Public School Performance in the United States has plummated over the past 20 years. It is unfair to force taxpayers to contribute to a school system that does not serve them. Following the Canadian System, Congress should form a system for public funding of religious schools for families opt out of the public school system.4. Violence on television influences children to behave violently. Although the financial benefit for networks is great, it is ultimately counterproductive to air violent television shows. Because violence on television is harmful to all strata of American society, strict guidelines for permissible content of television shows should be enacted5. Publicly funded art is the most expensive art in the world. Taxpayer funding for public art produces a low yield both physically and spiritually. Congress should discontinue funding for the organization since public art produces benefits that are vastly outweighed by its costFor every paragraph, identify the claim of fact, claim of value and claim of policy.Use the template below:Paragraph 1:Claim of Fact :Claim of Value:Claim of Policy:​</h2><br />
