                    <p>Family Cook By Alma Anonas-Carpio All Soul’s Day means the family will be over to partake of the family feast of favorites. Lolo Cholo’s caldereta, Lola Ninay’s Sinigang na Ulo sa Miso. Tito Pascualito’s Beef Tapa con Ampalaya will make its first appearance at the table this year, beside the box of Krispy Kreme chocolate donuts young Paquito used to scarf down when his chemo permitted. Saling set a furious pace for herself. She had kare-kare from scratch to prepare for the clan and she had but a few more hours to get it done as she’d always gotten it done: Perfect, hot, served with spicy shrimp paste she’d sauteed from scratch with bird’s eye chilies from the backyard. There’s the leche flan to chill yet, she thinks as her cook’s knife decimates the banana hearts on the chopping board. Her hands fly over the talyasi in the yard sitting on its roaring wood fire, testing the heat before she begins the process of making the perfect oxtail in peanut sauce stew. The family will want this dish as she makes it each year: The meat fork-tender, the sauce rich and sinful. After all, this is the one time in the year she gets to make it for everyone. Decades of love in a huge wok, the simmering heart of her, this is the best expression of love Saling knows—and she never fails to express it with piquancy, with heat, with all her heart and soul poured into every morsel and drip of sauce. Saling pops the flans in the ref and moves on to the sink to wash up. It just wouldn’t do to leave the care of her precious cookware to the kids. Might as well do this while the stew simmers. Somewhere in the yard, a time-addled rooster crows at the witching hour. Saling turns her face up to the ebbing moonlight filtering into the outdoor kitchen. She closes her eyes as she calls the names of every clan member over the slow-bubbling kare-kare, dropping the okra and pechay in carefully, giving the lot a final firm stir before setting the lid on the huge wok. Saling takes a few minutes to look at each window of the old house where she’d spent the happiest moments and some of the most difficult days of her life. Breaking her reverie, she ladles the stew into large clay pots and sets them and the little sauce-bowls of sauteed shrimp-fry out on the buffet table set up in the ancestral home’s sala (the family always set that up ahead of time, of course), her smile tired, but so very satisfied. 1.

Based on the selection, how does Filipino family celebrate All Souls Day? 5.

Some enjoy it with scrambled egg or hotdog, while others fill it with butter or jam. Still others prefer toasted pan de sal with margarine. There are many ways to enjoy pan de sal at every Filipino table. 2.) Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. There is coolness, calmness, when the sun does set. 3.) Man is a social being. Every day, she/he interacts with others in the community. He/She meets different people in varied situations and necessities to survive. Just like students go to school and learn from their teachers. Parents go to the office and work with their officemates. Drivers pick up passengers. Vendors sell their merchandise to various customers. An individual encounters different people day in and day out. Thus, a person should learn how to mingle with others in positive ways so that people would establish healthy relationships among themselves.​</a>

Which group do you think has more Spanish influence? Why?According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, a Liturgy is a fixed set of ceremonies that are used duringpublic worship in a religion. Every religion or sect has its own rites for praising God. These may be in a formof bible sharing, testimonies, singing, dancing, and chanting. Our discussion will dwell more on the RomanCatholic religion's liturgy, since majority of our country's population are baptized in this religion.For the Catholics, liturgy is about God's saving work present in the life, death and resurrection ofJesus, and the highlight of these three is the celebration of the Holy Mass wherein the priest is the maincelebrant. The Holy Mass is the highest form of liturgy with which the body and blood of Christ is the centerof the whole celebration. Liturgy is a ritual prayer of a community and each member takes part in thecelebration. And this is where Liturgical Music comes in.MThe first type of liturgical music that Filipinos learned from the Spaniards was in Latin. During theLiturgy, they sang Gregorian Chants, hymns and all forms of sacred music in Latin. Gradually, aside fromsinging, Spaniards taught the natives to play musical instruments like guitar, violin, flute and the organ.Later on, the music in different churches blossomed in 1857, a boys' choir was formed in Sto. DomingoDominican convent and later a pipe organ was installed. In 1601, the first orchestra was formed in theAugustinian convent in Guadalupe, in 1643, the Manila Orchestra was organized by a priest, between 1816 -1824, the famous Bamboo Organ was built. In 1870, Marcelo Adonay, the first native Filipino to compose amass, led an orchestra which was formed at San Agustine Church in Intramuros.Because the natives wanted a liturgy that they can understand aside from the Latin liturgicalcelebrations in churches, extra liturgical services outside the churches evolved. The Panuluyan,Pabasa,Salubong and other forms of devotions were sang in Spanish and in their native tongue.In 1903, Pope Pius X encouraged the participation of the congregation in the celebration of theLiturgy. This led to the use of local language in Churches, like what we have today. The community is alsoencouraged to have an active participation in every liturgical celebration, either by singing, responses orgestures. There are specific persons who play an important role in the liturgy. They are called musicministers. They have the responsibility of ensuring that the music is appropriate to the liturgy. But what arethe criteria for choosing music? According to the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (CSL, 1963), one of thekey documents of Vatican II, the basic criteria for sacred music are:​</a>

                                            As the dismaying predicament seemed beyond solution, Rizal’s nimble brain conceived a cute solution. Appearing perfectly at ease, he turned to the waiter and said, “My dear fellow,” he spoke in French, “don’t you worry.” Pointing to Luna with a flourish of his hand, he said, “Monsieur is quite right. I am the host of this party and I will take care of everything. But first, let my guests complete their meal. We must have black coffee and the best brandy the house can offer. I want the coffee to be freshly brewed. Tell the chef to boil it slowly and nicely. I’ll give him a handsome tip – and to be sure, you will receive a bigger one. The waiter relieved at the turn of the situation had taken and heartened by the promise of the big tip, went to the restaurant’s kitchen to supervise personally the making of the coffee. The brown gentlemen spoke such excellent French, he surely must be a rich potentiate or Maharajah from the Far East. There was really nothing to fear about the bill, so he mused. Back at the table, the Filipinos were demanding an explanation. Rizal was silent, his brown eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement. “Now, you’re making it worse,” upbraided the hot-tempered Luna. “You know we all have no money and still you ordered coffee and brandy to say nothing of the big tips you promised the cook and the waiter. Why do you want to disgrace us all? Are you a fool?” “No,” was Rizal’s laconic answer. To the great amazement of Luna and the others, Rizal took out from his coat pocket a portable water color set, and serenely began to paint a 10-pound sterling note on the porcelain platter. Dexterously, with a few master strokes he finished an astounding replica of the note before the arrival of the steaming coffee and the brandy. “My good fellow,” Rizal told the smiling waiter. Pointing to the platter: “There’s the payment for all we have taken. You may keep the change.” The waiter’s eyes lit up. Bowing low in the best tradition of a French waiter acknowledging an unusually good tip, the waiter was full of effusive thanks. “Monsieur is most generous, Merci!” reaching for the platter he bowed out with many sonorous kiss of his fingertips. Calmly, Rizal started to sip his coffee and brandy while enjoying the amazement on the faces of his compatriots who all held their breaths while waiting for what inevitably would happen next.Comprehension Check: What do you suppose happened right after?

The waiter relieved at the turn of the situation had taken and heartened by the promise of the big tip, went to the restaurant’s kitchen to supervise personally the making of the coffee. The brown gentlemen spoke such excellent French, he surely must be a rich potentiate or Maharajah from the Far East. There was really nothing to fear about the bill, so he mused. Back at the table, the Filipinos were demanding an explanation. Rizal was silent, his brown eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement. “Now, you’re making it worse,” upbraided the hot-tempered Luna. “You know we all have no money and still you ordered coffee and brandy to say nothing of the big tips you promised the cook and the waiter. Why do you want to disgrace us all? Are you a fool?” “No,” was Rizal’s laconic answer. To the great amazement of Luna and the others, Rizal took out from his coat pocket a portable water color set, and serenely began to paint a 10-pound sterling note on the porcelain platter. Dexterously, with a few master strokes he finished an astounding replica of the note before the arrival of the steaming coffee and the brandy. “My good fellow,” Rizal told the smiling waiter. Pointing to the platter: “There’s the payment for all we have taken. You may keep the change.” The waiter’s eyes lit up. Bowing low in the best tradition of a French waiter acknowledging an unusually good tip, the waiter was full of effusive thanks. “Monsieur is most generous, Merci!” reaching for the platter he bowed out with many sonorous kiss of his fingertips. Calmly, Rizal started to sip his coffee and brandy while enjoying the amazement on the faces of his compatriots who all held their breaths while waiting for what inevitably would happen next.

                            1. Family Cook By Alma Anonas-Carpio All Soul’s Day means the family will be over to partake of the family feast of favorites. Lolo Cholo’s caldereta, Lola Ninay’s Sinigang na Ulo sa Miso. Tito Pascualito’s Beef Tapa con Ampalaya will make its first appearance at the table this year, beside the box of Krispy Kreme chocolate donuts young Paquito used to scarf down when his chemo permitted. Saling set a furious pace for herself. She had kare-kare from scratch to prepare for the clan and she had but a few more hours to get it done as she’d always gotten it done: Perfect, hot, served with spicy shrimp paste she’d sauteed from scratch with bird’s eye chilies from the backyard. There’s the leche flan to chill yet, she thinks as her cook’s knife decimates the banana hearts on the chopping board. Her hands fly over the talyasi in the yard sitting on its roaring wood fire, testing the heat before she begins the process of making the perfect oxtail in peanut sauce stew. The family will want this dish as she makes it each year: The meat fork-tender, the sauce rich and sinful. After all, this is the one time in the year she gets to make it for everyone. Decades of love in a huge wok, the simmering heart of her, this is the best expression of love Saling knows—and she never fails to express it with piquancy, with heat, with all her heart and soul poured into every morsel and drip of sauce. Saling pops the flans in the ref and moves on to the sink to wash up. It just wouldn’t do to leave the care of her precious cookware to the kids. Might as well do this while the stew simmers. Somewhere in the yard, a time-addled rooster crows at the witching hour. Saling turns her face up to the ebbing moonlight filtering into the outdoor kitchen. She closes her eyes as she calls the names of every clan member over the slow-bubbling kare-kare, dropping the okra and pechay in carefully, giving the lot a final firm stir before setting the lid on the huge wok. Saling takes a few minutes to look at each window of the old house where she’d spent the happiest moments and some of the most difficult days of her life. Breaking her reverie, she ladles the stew into large clay pots and sets them and the little sauce-bowls of sauteed shrimp-fry out on the buffet table set up in the ancestral home’s sala (the family always set that up ahead of time, of course), her smile tired, but so very satisfied. 1. Who is Saling? How did the author describe her in the story? 2. How does the author describe the setting of the story? 3. What Filipino tradition is described in the selection? 4. Based on the selection, how does Filipino family celebrate All Souls Day? 5.

Why?According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, a Liturgy is a fixed set of ceremonies that are used duringpublic worship in a religion. Every religion or sect has its own rites for praising God. These may be in a formof bible sharing, testimonies, singing, dancing, and chanting. Our discussion will dwell more on the RomanCatholic religion's liturgy, since majority of our country's population are baptized in this religion.For the Catholics, liturgy is about God's saving work present in the life, death and resurrection ofJesus, and the highlight of these three is the celebration of the Holy Mass wherein the priest is the maincelebrant. The Holy Mass is the highest form of liturgy with which the body and blood of Christ is the centerof the whole celebration. Liturgy is a ritual prayer of a community and each member takes part in thecelebration. And this is where Liturgical Music comes in.MThe first type of liturgical music that Filipinos learned from the Spaniards was in Latin. During theLiturgy, they sang Gregorian Chants, hymns and all forms of sacred music in Latin. Gradually, aside fromsinging, Spaniards taught the natives to play musical instruments like guitar, violin, flute and the organ.Later on, the music in different churches blossomed in 1857, a boys' choir was formed in Sto. DomingoDominican convent and later a pipe organ was installed. In 1601, the first orchestra was formed in theAugustinian convent in Guadalupe, in 1643, the Manila Orchestra was organized by a priest, between 1816 -1824, the famous Bamboo Organ was built. In 1870, Marcelo Adonay, the first native Filipino to compose amass, led an orchestra which was formed at San Agustine Church in Intramuros.Because the natives wanted a liturgy that they can understand aside from the Latin liturgicalcelebrations in churches, extra liturgical services outside the churches evolved. The Panuluyan,Pabasa,Salubong and other forms of devotions were sang in Spanish and in their native tongue.In 1903, Pope Pius X encouraged the participation of the congregation in the celebration of theLiturgy. This led to the use of local language in Churches, like what we have today. The community is alsoencouraged to have an active participation in every liturgical celebration, either by singing, responses orgestures. There are specific persons who play an important role in the liturgy. They are called musicministers. They have the responsibility of ensuring that the music is appropriate to the liturgy. But what arethe criteria for choosing music? According to the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (CSL, 1963), one of thekey documents of Vatican II, the basic criteria for sacred music are:​</h2><br />
