Guide QuestionsWhat do you notice with the flow of lines being formed?Which melody has a wider movement of music notes and which one has a closer note movement?On a wider scale, National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA’s) Felipe M. De Leon, in his article about the Diversity of Philippine Music Cultures mentioned some contrasting features of Ilocanos’ and the Visayans’ art forms. Ilocanos prefer the movement of their music to be closer (conjunct) while the Visayans like it farther (disjunct). Ilocano dances have inward hand and arms movement while the Visayans have outward gestures. These intriguing polar artistic characteristics of the two subcultures may have rooted from their own natural values, the Ilocanos’ reserve attitude and the Visayans’ being highly-spirited; the Ilocanos’ survival instinct and the Visayans’ jubilant nature. TRANSFERAfter listening to the audio sample provided, try to answer the following questions. 1. What do you notice about the melody? What instrument played it? 2. How about the mood of the pieces?

                                            translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</a>

                                            So, what do you notice with each pair in every item? If you say that they show relationships, then you are correct The term that means "word relationships" is called Analogy. It is like a word puzzle. It always contains two pairs of words. It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79, making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally. In a pure form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium and also as mineral inclusions such as within pyrite. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>hope </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>helps</strong></p><br />

                            14. Activity 2Listening Activity! Guide QuestionsWhat do you notice with the flow of lines being formed?Which melody has a wider movement of music notes and which one has a closer note movement?On a wider scale, National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA’s) Felipe M. De Leon, in his article about the Diversity of Philippine Music Cultures mentioned some contrasting features of Ilocanos’ and the Visayans’ art forms. Ilocanos prefer the movement of their music to be closer (conjunct) while the Visayans like it farther (disjunct). Ilocano dances have inward hand and arms movement while the Visayans have outward gestures. These intriguing polar artistic characteristics of the two subcultures may have rooted from their own natural values, the Ilocanos’ reserve attitude and the Visayans’ being highly-spirited; the Ilocanos’ survival instinct and the Visayans’ jubilant nature. TRANSFERAfter listening to the audio sample provided, try to answer the following questions. 1. What do you notice about the melody? What instrument played it? 2. How about the mood of the pieces? How can you say that it shows a happy mood, a sad mood, a relax mood, a playful mood, a patriotic mood? 3. Suppose all the instruments will only play the melody of the piece, what do you think will be your general impression about the piece? 4. How does the dynamics of the piece affect its overall sound? Which is better, a piece with dynamics or without dynamics? Why? 5. If ever you will choose your rondalla instrument, what will it be? Why? 6. After listening each given folksong, how would you differentiate the characteristics of the Tagalog, Ilocano, and Bicolano folksongs?makikisagot po ng maayos and yung link ng vid po is nasa pic hehe thank youuuu​</h2><br />

                            23. translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Misunderstandings in academe are common and often innocuous, yet they can create conflict. Perhaps someone misheard something you said, and now they are angry with you. Perhaps they heard your words correctly but comprehended them in a manner that did not align with your intent. Or perhaps they interpreted your silence in a way that was inconsistent with the message you wanted to send.

</p><p>Regardless of their source, misunderstandings can damage relationships if they are not handled quickly. I would like to share a few ways that you can resolve misunderstandings in a manner that preserves the working relationships you have spent time and energy building.</p><p></p><strong>2. </strong><strong>Schedule Family Time.

                            25. So, what do you notice with each pair in every item? If you say that they show relationships, then you are correct The term that means "word relationships" is called Analogy. It is like a word puzzle. It always contains two pairs of words. It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</h2><br />
