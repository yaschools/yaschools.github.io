                                            can you find the main idea of the statement below:The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global economic slowdown. But there are debates on why economic growth has not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest. Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to make economic growth truly inclusive. This policy note examines trends in official (monetary) poverty statistics. It also looks into why poverty reduction has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the country. It pointrd out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more likely slide into poverty. This suggests that government should not onlu br concerned with the poor, but should also have policy instruments to assist those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.​​pls answer it for research purpose thank you​</a>

But there are people who wonder why economic growth has not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest.

It is also looks into why poverty reduction has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks. ​</a>

DIRECTION: Read the academic texts below and summarize them using the
listed procedures. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.
A. With the enactment of the K to 12 program, the basic education cycle is extended
to include two additional years at the secondary level. Enrolment in senior high
school (SHS), which will comprise Grade 11 and 12, is expected to increase to
2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in
school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for
the SHS program. This Policy Note does an initial assessment of the K to 12
program’s effect on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected
demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as
possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the
additional demand for places in SHSs.
B. Filipino women are active as entrepreneurs. Data from the Department of Trade
and Industry for 2009 show that 54 percent of enterprises are owned by women.
This Policy Note discusses the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs. To
achieve inclusively growth in the Asia- Pacific region, it is critical to increase the
economic opportunities of women in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) economies. APEC members must take national-level and regional
actions toward creating enabling environments for women enterprises and
empowering women entrepreneurs. The significant number of women
entrepreneurs reflects the huge potential of women to make substantial
contributions to the national economy. For this to be realized, they need to be
supported through appropriate and timely interventions toward growing and
scaling up their business.
C. The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global
economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has
not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also
barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by
economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest.
Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to
capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to
make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in
official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction
has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that
provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the
country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more
likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been
vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only
be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist
those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.</a>

                            4. can you find the main idea of the statement below:The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global economic slowdown. But there are debates on why economic growth has not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest. Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to make economic growth truly inclusive. This policy note examines trends in official (monetary) poverty statistics. It also looks into why poverty reduction has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the country. It pointrd out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more likely slide into poverty. This suggests that government should not onlu br concerned with the poor, but should also have policy instruments to assist those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.​​pls answer it for research purpose thank you​</h2><br />

DIRECTION: Read the academic texts below and summarize them using the
listed procedures. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.
A. With the enactment of the K to 12 program, the basic education cycle is extended
to include two additional years at the secondary level. Enrolment in senior high
school (SHS), which will comprise Grade 11 and 12, is expected to increase to
2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in
school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for
the SHS program. This Policy Note does an initial assessment of the K to 12
program’s effect on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected
demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as
possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the
additional demand for places in SHSs.
B. Filipino women are active as entrepreneurs. Data from the Department of Trade
and Industry for 2009 show that 54 percent of enterprises are owned by women.
This Policy Note discusses the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs. To
achieve inclusively growth in the Asia- Pacific region, it is critical to increase the
economic opportunities of women in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) economies. APEC members must take national-level and regional
actions toward creating enabling environments for women enterprises and
empowering women entrepreneurs. The significant number of women
entrepreneurs reflects the huge potential of women to make substantial
contributions to the national economy. For this to be realized, they need to be
supported through appropriate and timely interventions toward growing and
scaling up their business.
C. The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global
economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has
not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also
barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by
economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest.
Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to
capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to
make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in
official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction
has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that
provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the
country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more
likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been
vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only
be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist
those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.</h2><br />
