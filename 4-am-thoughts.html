We have thoughts that we strive to be one of them. But not all the people on this planet has the capacity to become a millionaire. Sometimes, some individuals are lucky enough to enjoy those moments. And you could buy everything you want for yourself and your family. </p><p></p><p>If I could have a chance to be a <strong>millionaire</strong>, I wanted to buy a house for my family. All I have will also be shared with them and make them happy. Moreover, becoming a millionaire is not just for me. Still, I wanted to share my blessings with other people. I also wanted them to be happy and enjoy what I gained and achieved in life. </p><p></p><p>I wanted to have a feeding program for all the people in need in these current times. Also, giving grocery bags to people experiencing poverty is one idea in my plan if I had a chance to become a <strong>millionaire</strong>. Then, I was also planning to give children and students some school supplies they need in order to continue their education despite hard times in their life. A simple gift to them will make their day, and that's what I want. </p><p></p><p>Being a <strong>millionaire </strong>is a dream to many. In other words, they mainly pursue having more money these days. However, we should have a good motive and kindness if we gain something other people cannot obtain. Always look to the bright side and make a habit of helping others and not just focusing on ourselves. </p><p></p><p>Do not let greed be the first one to happen. Decide what makes us happy and others also. In short, always give and do not be selfish. </p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more here: </strong>brainly.ph/question/1020485</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
