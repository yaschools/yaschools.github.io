with virtue and happiness. "This good fortune is offered me today. Why wait until
tomorrow? Should I not speak to this pretty girl now?" Yi Mongyong said to himself.

                                            Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</a>

                                            pls translate to Tagalog/Filipino.It's great that the economy is growing and rebounding back from the hit it took from the COVID-19 pandemic. It's not there yet, but I'm optimistic about the situation.The government's plan to keep up the rise and recover by acceleration of the vaccineprogram is one I'm certainly looking forward to. If this pace continues, we're certainly recover.Further on, oil prices going to be still high or not is certainly another thing to watch out for, which the chief of the Natural Economic and Development authority said the country will be doing. They're saying they have it if it does go up, as I have no idea what they're talking about I'm going to trust them. Moving forward, Both industry and service sectors growing is positive, but agriculture growth being impeded and even pushed back by typhoons and the African swine fever is a shame. The rise in gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily driven by household consumption accounting for 5.2 percentage of overall GDP growth is great, I guess I'll have to buy more or something to help the economy.My reaction really isn't much of a reaction, but I certainly hope I'll understand most of these terms by the end of the school year.​</a>

He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</a>

Panganay na anak ni Haring Saul si Jonathan. Isa siyang matapang na mandirigma. Sinabi ni David na mas mabilis pa si Jonathan kaysa sa agila at mas malakas pa kaysa sa leon. Dahil si Jonathan ang panganay na anak ni Saul, siya dapat ang susunod na magiging hari ng Israel. Subalit batid niya na si David ang pinili ni Diyos na susunod na magiging hari. Imbes na mainggit, naging matalik na magkaibigan sina Jonathan at David. Nangako silang poprotektahan at ipagtatanggol nila ang isa’t isa. Ibinigay ni Jonathan kay David ang kaniyang damit, espada, pana, at sinturon bilang tanda o simbolo ng kanilang pagkakaibigan. Noong panahong tumatakas si David kay Saul, pinuntahan siya ni Jonathan at sinabing: ‘Huwag kang matakot. Ikaw ang pinili ni Diyos na maging hari, at batid ’yan ng aking ama.’ Ilang beses ding nanganib ang buhay ni Jonathan dahil sa pagtulong sa kanyang kaibigang si David. Alam niyang gustong patayin ni Haring Saul ang kanyang kaibigan, kaya kinausap niya ang kaniyang ama at sinabi: ‘Magkakasala ka kapag pinatay mo si David; wala naman siyang kasalanan sa iyo.’ Si Haring Saul ay nagalit kay Jonathan. Makalipas ang ilang taon, magkasamang namatay sa digmaan sina Haring Saul at Jonathan. Pumalit sa puwesto ng pagiging hari si David. Hinanap ni Haring David ang anak ni Jonathan na si Mepiboset. Nang magkita sila, sinabi ni David kay Mepiboset: ‘Matalik kong kaibigan ang iyong ama, kaya hindi kita pababayaan. Maninirahan ka sa palasyo ko at kakain sa mesa ko.’ Hindi nalimutan ni Haring David ang kanyag kaibigan at pinagpatuloy ang naging pangako kay Jonathan sa pamamagitan ng kanyang naging anak.
(English)
King Saul's eldest son Jonathan. He was a brave warrior. David said that Jonathan was even faster than the eagle and even stronger than the lion. Since Jonathan was Saul's firstborn son, he was to be the next king of Israel. But he knew that God had chosen David to be the next king. Instead of being jealous, Jonathan and David became close friends. They promised to protect and defend each other. Jonathan gave David his garment, sword, bow, and belt as a sign or symbol of their friendship. When David is fleeing from Saul, Jonathan comes to him and says: 'Do not be afraid. You are the one God has chosen to be king, and my father knows that. ’Jonathan’s life was also in danger several times for helping his friend David. He knew that King Saul wanted to kill his friend, so he spoke to his father and said: ‘You will sin if you kill David; he has not sinned against you. ’King Saul was angry with Jonathan. Some years later, King Saul and Jonathan died together in battle. David succeeds him as king. King David sought out Jonathan's son Mephibosheth. When they meet, David tells Mephibosheth: 'Your father is a close friend of mine, so I will not leave you. You will live in my palace and eat at my table. ’King David did not forget his handsome friend and continued the promise made to Jonathan through his son.

Above all, pain enriches the mind.The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one’s death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes.</p><p></p><p><strong>@</strong><strong>K</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>U</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>H</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            4. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice. One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, thewoman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation. answer thisBEFORE1.2.3.4.5.AFTER1. 2. 3. 4. 5.​​</h2><br />

                            5. pls translate to Tagalog/Filipino.It's great that the economy is growing and rebounding back from the hit it took from the COVID-19 pandemic. It's not there yet, but I'm optimistic about the situation.The government's plan to keep up the rise and recover by acceleration of the vaccineprogram is one I'm certainly looking forward to. If this pace continues, we're certainly recover.Further on, oil prices going to be still high or not is certainly another thing to watch out for, which the chief of the Natural Economic and Development authority said the country will be doing. They're saying they have it if it does go up, as I have no idea what they're talking about I'm going to trust them. Moving forward, Both industry and service sectors growing is positive, but agriculture growth being impeded and even pushed back by typhoons and the African swine fever is a shame. The rise in gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily driven by household consumption accounting for 5.2 percentage of overall GDP growth is great, I guess I'll have to buy more or something to help the economy.My reaction really isn't much of a reaction, but I certainly hope I'll understand most of these terms by the end of the school year.​</h2><br />

                            12. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the 
woman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars.

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</h2><br />

                            15. Jonathan at David
(Tagalog)
Panganay na anak ni Haring Saul si Jonathan. Isa siyang matapang na mandirigma. Sinabi ni David na mas mabilis pa si Jonathan kaysa sa agila at mas malakas pa kaysa sa leon. Dahil si Jonathan ang panganay na anak ni Saul, siya dapat ang susunod na magiging hari ng Israel. Subalit batid niya na si David ang pinili ni Diyos na susunod na magiging hari. Imbes na mainggit, naging matalik na magkaibigan sina Jonathan at David. Nangako silang poprotektahan at ipagtatanggol nila ang isa’t isa. Ibinigay ni Jonathan kay David ang kaniyang damit, espada, pana, at sinturon bilang tanda o simbolo ng kanilang pagkakaibigan. Noong panahong tumatakas si David kay Saul, pinuntahan siya ni Jonathan at sinabing: ‘Huwag kang matakot. Ikaw ang pinili ni Diyos na maging hari, at batid ’yan ng aking ama.’ Ilang beses ding nanganib ang buhay ni Jonathan dahil sa pagtulong sa kanyang kaibigang si David. Alam niyang gustong patayin ni Haring Saul ang kanyang kaibigan, kaya kinausap niya ang kaniyang ama at sinabi: ‘Magkakasala ka kapag pinatay mo si David; wala naman siyang kasalanan sa iyo.’ Si Haring Saul ay nagalit kay Jonathan. Makalipas ang ilang taon, magkasamang namatay sa digmaan sina Haring Saul at Jonathan. Pumalit sa puwesto ng pagiging hari si David. Hinanap ni Haring David ang anak ni Jonathan na si Mepiboset. Nang magkita sila, sinabi ni David kay Mepiboset: ‘Matalik kong kaibigan ang iyong ama, kaya hindi kita pababayaan. Maninirahan ka sa palasyo ko at kakain sa mesa ko.’ Hindi nalimutan ni Haring David ang kanyag kaibigan at pinagpatuloy ang naging pangako kay Jonathan sa pamamagitan ng kanyang naging anak.
(English)
King Saul's eldest son Jonathan. He was a brave warrior. David said that Jonathan was even faster than the eagle and even stronger than the lion. Since Jonathan was Saul's firstborn son, he was to be the next king of Israel. But he knew that God had chosen David to be the next king. Instead of being jealous, Jonathan and David became close friends. They promised to protect and defend each other. Jonathan gave David his garment, sword, bow, and belt as a sign or symbol of their friendship. When David is fleeing from Saul, Jonathan comes to him and says: 'Do not be afraid. You are the one God has chosen to be king, and my father knows that. ’Jonathan’s life was also in danger several times for helping his friend David. He knew that King Saul wanted to kill his friend, so he spoke to his father and said: ‘You will sin if you kill David; he has not sinned against you. ’King Saul was angry with Jonathan. Some years later, King Saul and Jonathan died together in battle. David succeeds him as king. King David sought out Jonathan's son Mephibosheth. When they meet, David tells Mephibosheth: 'Your father is a close friend of mine, so I will not leave you. You will live in my palace and eat at my table. ’King David did not forget his handsome friend and continued the promise made to Jonathan through his son.
