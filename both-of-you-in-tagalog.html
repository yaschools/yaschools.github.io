                                            - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

Harana is a Filipino tradition of serenading a woman which derives its rhythmic style from the Harana Balitaw sung in triple meter. This secular music originated in the Visayas region, although some tagalog version Balitaw is an extemporaneous exchange of verses between a man and a woman and usually of balitaw music can also be found in some parts of the central and southern tagalog regions. A woman may express her message in the final stanzas of the song if she willfully accepts a man's suit or proposal for her. Both performers dance while singing. Tagalog versions of balitaw sometimes describe nature, places, or things figuratively but the inner message will also lead in love and courtship, pictures?

The villagers lived a simple and peaceful life, but they always felt a sense of awe and respect for the mountain, which they believed was home to powerful spirits.</p><p></p><p>One day, a group of strangers arrived in the village. They were a team of scientists who had come to study the mountain's geology and wildlife. The villagers were curious about the strangers, but also a bit wary. They had heard stories about outsiders who had come to exploit their resources and desecrate their sacred sites.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the team, a woman named Dr. Lee, approached the village elder, a wise and respected man named Kofi. "Greetings, elder," she said with a warm smile. "We come in peace and with respect for your ways. We only wish to learn more about your beautiful mountain and its secrets."</p><p></p><p>Kofi studied her for a moment, then nodded. "I see no harm in sharing our knowledge with those who seek it with humility and openness," he said. "But you must understand that our mountain is more than a mere object of study. It is a living being, with its own will and desires. We must treat it with care and reverence."</p><p></p><p>Dr. Lee listened attentively and nodded. "I understand, elder. We will do our best to honor your traditions and protect the mountain's integrity. We are not here to exploit or harm, but to learn and share."</p><p></p><p>Over the next few weeks, the scientists worked hard to collect data and samples from the mountain, while also respecting the villagers' customs and beliefs. They even invited some of the villagers to join them in their research, and showed them how their findings could benefit the local ecosystem and economy.</p><p></p><p>As they packed up to leave, Dr. Lee approached Kofi once more. "Thank you for your hospitality and wisdom, elder," she said. "We have learned so much from you and your people. We hope to continue this partnership and friendship in the future."</p><p></p><p>Kofi smiled and clasped her hand. "The mountain has spoken to me, Dr. Lee," he said. "It has told me that your intentions are pure and your hearts are open. You and your team are always welcome here, as long as you remember to listen to the mountain's voice and honor its spirit."</p><p></p><p>GIVE BRAINLIEST</p><br />

                            25. - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.
