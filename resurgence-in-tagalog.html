Based on your observation, your dog always comes running to you when he hears you open the can of dog food and salivates from the smell of it. ________ 23. It is revealed in your study that few of your classmates are exceptionally good in language, and there are some who are mathematically inclined. Some classmates are also excellent in music and sport. ________ 24. You noticed that children always ask questions and consistently curious about how things came to be. ________ 25.

Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</a>

Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</h2><br />

Many new or previously unrecognized bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic diseases have emerged within the past two decades. At the same time, many once-controlled infections have re-emerged or become resistant to antimicrobial therapy. This emergence is the result of changes in society, technology, the environment, and the microbes themselves, and these changes have had often unpredictable consequences. Important factors influencing emergence include changes in human demographics and behaviour, changes in technology and industry, changes in economic development and land use, increasing and rapid international travel and commerce, microbial adaptation and change, and the breakdown of public health measures. Addressing emerging infectious diseases will require international and interdisciplinary partnerships to build an appropriate infrastructure to detect and respond to these often unanticipated threats to health.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3.Several factors contribute to the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases, but most can be linked with the increasing number of people living and moving on earth: rapid and intense international travel; overcrowding in cities with poor sanitation; changes in handling and processing of large quantities of food ...</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps :)</p><br />
