“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</a>

Rizal was known for his charming personality and social skills, which allowed him to build relationships and establish connections with people from various backgrounds. He was also known for his intelligence, wit, and humor, which made him a popular figure among his peers. Rizal had friends from different walks of life, and he was able to engage in conversations with people from various social classes and cultural backgrounds. However, it is also worth noting that Rizal was a complex individual who held strong beliefs and principles, and he was not afraid to speak out against injustice and oppression. Despite this, Rizal's congenial personality and ability to connect with people made him a beloved figure in Philippine history.</p><br />

                            4. In what ways did economic competition between countries "come at the expense of others"? Select all correct answers.
Countries paid taxes to each other.
The colonies supplied goods to the mother country.
The colonies traded supplies in route.
All interactions with other countries were congenial.
Competition was intense for economic control.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Economic competition</strong> can affect the other country with regards to its supply of goods. Since the colonies traded <strong>supplies</strong> in routes, these interaction will be broken through the imposition of higher <strong>taxes</strong>. For example, the product of the Philippines is banana and the product of Japan is apple. if there will be a competition between the two countries the tendency is that Japan will have to increase tax imposition with regards to their apple products and the Philippines will find it very expensive to buy apples from Japan thus losing much money. The Philippines on the other hand may stop the trade of banana and Japan will also incur damages by looking for another country supplier that will provide them with bananas. If the country supplier they will acquire could not meet the same standard as the Philippines' products they will incur damages and increase of prices because the demand for Philippine banana which they cannot import anymore will increase.</p><p></p><p>Related links:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/407088</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1251388</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/379580</p><br />

                        Jose Rizal was an intellectual, as evidenced by the records and works he left behind.<p>He was a doctor by profession, but he was also a poet, novelist, painter, sculptor, chess champion, and polyglot. He was so gifted that it appears too good to be true for a Filipino of his time. Rizal's influence on us, in my opinion, is to live to your full potential and to share that potential with others. He also encourages Filipinos to be brave and courageous, regardless of their size or color. Knowing he comes from a wealthy family, he inspires fortunate Filipinos to use their resources wisely rather than for vanity. Overall, he is deserving of the title of a<strong> national hero.</strong></p><p></p>Further explanation:Is it prudent to invest in education? What is your reasoning?<p>So why not? Because investing in education outperforms investing in bonds and stocks. Education investment entails all gains and no losses. Never stop learning, and don't let your age slow you down. Self-education is the only investment that does not lose value over time.</p><p></p>What, in your opinion, is the essence of Rizal's journey?<p>According to legend, Jose Rizal was the most traveled Filipino hero in history. Jose Rizal's travels and adventures are an important part of his education and mission for the Philippines. His broad knowledge of different cultures gained from his journey served as his inspiration for Reform.</p><p></p>What can students learn from Rizal's seemingly never-ending quest for knowledge?<p>His quest for knowledge was no different from that of any other <strong>intelligent</strong> person with the means to pursue his interests. Then I'd say there's no evidence that she was particularly well-informed about anything. However, there's no denying that he talked a good game, and the people were desperate for someone to listen to him, which explains his influence.</p><p></p>Would you pursue additional studies like the national hero if given the chance? If so, why or why not?<p>So why not? Because everyone wishes to be a hero, right? But you can be a hero not just because you study to be a national hero; simply helping others in need is enough to make you a hero. So be cooperative and kind to others, and that will suffice for me.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about Jose Rizal here: https://brainly.ph/question/108377</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Both work discipline and congeniality are important qualities for a manager, but the ideal manager would be someone who can balance both effectively. A manager who emphasizes work discipline can ensure that employees are accountable for their responsibilities, deadlines are met, and work is completed efficiently. On the other hand, a manager who emphasizes congeniality can foster a positive work environment, build strong relationships with employees, and create a sense of teamwork and collaboration.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the best approach depends on the specific needs and culture of the company. A manager who can find the right balance between work discipline and congeniality can create a productive work environment where employees feel motivated, supported, and valued. It is important for a manager to understand the unique dynamics of their team and organization and adjust their management style accordingly</p><br />

“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</h2><br />

In comparison to a personal essay, a formal essay is more meticulously planned and serious. Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman who lived between the mid-1950s and the early 1600s, is credited with creating the formal essay. His works cover topics like death, fear, truth, and riches and are condensed, impartial, and informed. The writing style of a personal essay is informal and conversational. The informality of the personal essay is one of its main qualities. Its primary goal is to pique interest, with informational value coming second. As a result, compared to the formal essay, it is a more aesthetic and less practical type of production.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
