FILIPINOS
By Judith Kempis
Filipinos are hardworking and responsible
Friendly to others and all hospitable
Good moral values and respectful most of all
With long-patience and all lovable.
Filipinos help each other, whether rich or poor
For those who need especially the neighbor
Filipinos are brave and pride they stand for
To protect and fight for country is worth dying for.
Filipinos are always smiling
Though some nation keeps on insulting
For being simple, low status of living
But heart and mind are of rich human being.
I am proud to be a Filipino, in blood and skin
The religion of Christianity in God we believed in
Our own mother tongue we use and for grandchildren
The culture and tradition from ancient till next generation.

                                            The Filipino culture I have learned is one that is a very vibrant and alive. It is a blend of many cultures that have come to our shores &amp; rooted in our own native Filipino culture. Many scholars say that culture is constantly changing that is why it is very hard to define. While this is true, sometimes, it is not changing for the better. In some ways, I believe this is happening to Filipino culture. Filipinos tend to put more importance to foreign culture and things as compared to our own. Many foreign ideas and ways of thinking is what we, Filipinos believe will bring the country progress. However, this is a mistake because our culture is such a rich melting pot from which we can draw inspiration and ideas. a - The Importance of Recognizing Our Culture by Pammy Macasaet Questions What is the topic of the paragraph? 2.

Filipino Learners Learn the New Way The implementation of the new learning modalities is no joke! There are several opinions, beliefs, observations, and views on the new learning modalities in the Philippine education system. There are some who reacted negatively and some others embrace the new learning modalities positively. Issues on the difficulties of learners' coping on the new way of learning, teachers' way of teaching, and financial worries of parents have been raised. Undeniably, the learning modalities are truly unusual and challenging not just to learners but to the teachers as well. Delivering lessons through modules and online classes in different subjects has surely challenged the capacity and patience of learners, parents, and teachers. This entails hard work among the proponents to make things possible. Financial, physical, mental, and emotional attributions must be considered as well. Salute to all concerned individuals who have made the new normal learning modalities possible. Gradually, learners and teachers have learned to appreciate the new learning modalities. The Filipinos are hopeful that even in this time of COVID-19 pandemic, the new learning modalities would bring positive effects on the teaching-learning process in the Philippines. 1.

Because of You - Kelly Clarkson
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

FILIPINOS
By Judith Kempis
Filipinos are hardworking and responsible
Friendly to others and all hospitable
Good moral values and respectful most of all
With long-patience and all lovable.
Filipinos help each other, whether rich or poor
For those who need especially the neighbor
Filipinos are brave and pride they stand for
To protect and fight for country is worth dying for.
Filipinos are always smiling
Though some nation keeps on insulting
For being simple, low status of living
But heart and mind are of rich human being.
I am proud to be a Filipino, in blood and skin
The religion of Christianity in God we believed in
Our own mother tongue we use and for grandchildren
The culture and tradition from ancient till next generation.

                            14. The Filipino culture I have learned is one that is a very vibrant and alive. It is a blend of many cultures that have come to our shores &amp; rooted in our own native Filipino culture. Many scholars say that culture is constantly changing that is why it is very hard to define. While this is true, sometimes, it is not changing for the better. In some ways, I believe this is happening to Filipino culture. Filipinos tend to put more importance to foreign culture and things as compared to our own. Many foreign ideas and ways of thinking is what we, Filipinos believe will bring the country progress. However, this is a mistake because our culture is such a rich melting pot from which we can draw inspiration and ideas. a - The Importance of Recognizing Our Culture by Pammy Macasaet Questions What is the topic of the paragraph? 2.

Filipino Learners Learn the New Way The implementation of the new learning modalities is no joke! There are several opinions, beliefs, observations, and views on the new learning modalities in the Philippine education system. There are some who reacted negatively and some others embrace the new learning modalities positively. Issues on the difficulties of learners' coping on the new way of learning, teachers' way of teaching, and financial worries of parents have been raised. Undeniably, the learning modalities are truly unusual and challenging not just to learners but to the teachers as well. Delivering lessons through modules and online classes in different subjects has surely challenged the capacity and patience of learners, parents, and teachers. This entails hard work among the proponents to make things possible. Financial, physical, mental, and emotional attributions must be considered as well. Salute to all concerned individuals who have made the new normal learning modalities possible. Gradually, learners and teachers have learned to appreciate the new learning modalities. The Filipinos are hopeful that even in this time of COVID-19 pandemic, the new learning modalities would bring positive effects on the teaching-learning process in the Philippines. 1.
