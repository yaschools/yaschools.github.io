- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</a>

Emotional health is a component of mental health. If you are in control of your
thoughts, feelings, and behavior, you are emotionally healthy. It means that you can
deal positively with reality, regardless whether the actual situation is good or bad.
How you feel affects how you think and act. If you are happy, you feel relaxed
doing even the most difficult tasks, But if you are sad, tensed or worried, you cannot
think properly and may not be able to do or finish a task.</a>

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</h2><br />

                        English<p></p><p>1. How could biases affect us if we do not detect them in the stories that we read, see, or hear?</p>We would be unconsciously discriminatory towards something since we would not know if it is bias or not.<p></p><p>2. How will you deal with people who have biased opinions different from yours?</p>I approach them with open-mindedness and consideration.   <p></p><p>3. What are some of the people, groups of people, things, events, or ideas that you have a bias against?</p>My biases are mostly associated with stereotypes like how younger people are ignorant and how older people are too judgemental.<p></p><p>4. What should you do to avoid making baseless biases?</p>I would avoid it through research. I would ask myself why and how is this more favorable than others.<p></p><p>5. How will you apply this skill of detecting biases in conversations, correspondences, or news reports/interviews? </p>I would apply with insight since not all biases are negative or hurtful.<p></p><p>[tex][/tex]</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLeaning</p><br />
