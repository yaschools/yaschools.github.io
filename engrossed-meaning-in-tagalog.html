I am not unmindful of the sentence of Seneca: “Throw aside all hindrances and give
up your time to attaining a sound mind,” to which he promptly adds, “No man can attain
it who is engrossed in other matters.” Now what I maintain is not that solitude develops
such a mind but that it is conducive to preserving and strengthening it, for I have not
forgotten another observation of the same writer to the effect that the place in which one
lives does not greatly contribute to one's tranquility.
