Lo! the Spear-Danes’ glory through splendid achievements
The folk-kings’ former fame we have heard of,
How princes displayed then their prowess-in-battle.
Oft Scyld the Scefing from scathers in numbers
From many a people their mead-benches tore.
Since first he found him friendless and wretched,
The earl had had terror: comfort he got for it,
Waxed ’neath the welkin, world-honor gained,
Till all his neighbors o’er sea were compelled to
Bow to his bidding and bring him their tribute:
An excellent atheling! After was borne him
A son and heir, young in his dwelling,
Whom God-Father sent to solace the people.
He had marked the misery malice had caused them</a>

                                            In the 15th century, the Europeans began to exploit the human resources of Africa. The Portuguese French, and English started to bring thousands of slaves back to mainland Europe and America, they were bought and sold like objects so they could work in plantations and serve their masters. This came to be known as the Atlantic Slave Trade. However, this commercial enterprise did not go an antislavery letter unchallenged as calls for abolition soon emerged. The following selection addressed to the Queen of England - is lifted from the autobiography of a prominent 18th century abolitionist. Though this man's birth name was Olaudah Equiano, the letter bears the signature "Gustavus Vassa"- the name given to him by the Royal Navy Officer who "bought" him from the slave trade.Letter to Queen Charlotte To Her Most Excellent Majesty: Your Majesty's well-known benevolence and humanity emboldens me to approach your royal presence, trusting that the obscurity of my situation will not prevent your majesty from attending to the sufferings for which I plead. Yet I do not solicit your royal pity for my own distress; my sufferings although numerous are, in a measure, forgotten. I supplicate your Majesty's compassion for the millions of my African countrymen, who groan under the lash of tyranny in the West Indies. The oppression and cruelty exercised to the unhappy negroes there, have at length reached the British legislature, and they are now deliberating on its redress; even several persons of property in slaves in the West Indies have petitioned parliament against its continuance, sensible that it is as impolitic as it is unjust and what is inhuman must ever be unwise. Your Majesty's reign has been hitherto distinguished by private acts of benevolence and bounty; surely the more extended the misery is, the greater claim it has to your Majesty's compassion, and the greater must be your Majesty's pleasure in administering to its relief. I presume, therefore, gracious Queen, to implore your interposition with your royal consort, in favour of the wretched Africans; that, by your Majesty's benevolent influence, a period may now be put to their misery; and that they may be raised from the condition of brutes to which they are at present degraded to the rights and situation of freemen, and admitted to partake of the blessings of your Majesty's happy government; so shall your Majesty enjoy the heartfelt pleasure of procuring happiness to millions, and be rewarded in the grateful prayers of themselves and of their posterity. And may the all-bountiful Creator shower on your Majesty and the Royal Family every blessing that this world can afford, and every fullness of joy which divine revelation has promised us in the next. I am your Majesty's most dutiful and devoted servant to command, No. 53, Baldwin's Gardens. Gustavus Vassa, The Oppressed Ethiopean 15200 h himComprehension Check Answer the following questions: 1. What is Equiano's main petition in his letter? What is he asking the Queen to grant? 2. What does Equiano's letter imply about the condition of the "wretched Africans"? What does he mean by the phrase? 3. According to Equiano, what reward could the Queen receive if she grants his petition? 4. Do you think this letter was effective in terms of conveying Equiano's true intentions? Why why not?​</a>

Rain is the subject of prayer, the kind gesture of saints. Dear City, explain your irreverence: in you, rain is a visitor with nowhere to go. Where is the ground that knows only the love of water? What are the passageways to your heart? Pity the water that stays and rises on the streets, pity the water that floods into houses, so dark and filthy and heavy with rats and dead leaves and plastic. How ashamed water is to be what you have made it. What have you done to its beauty, its graceful body in pictures of oceans, its clear face in a glass? We walk home and cannot see our feet in the flood. We forget to thank the gods for their kindness. We look for someone to blame and turn to you, wretched city, because we are men and women of honor, we feed our children three meals a day, we never miss an election. The only explanation is you, dear city. This is the end of our discussion. There is no other culprit.pls summarize this pls ​</a>

our ship ran onward toward the Ocean's bourne,
the realm and region of the Men of Winter,
hidden in mist and cloud. Never the flaming
eye of Helios lights on those men
at morning, when he climbs the sky of stars,
nor in descending earthward out of heaven;
ruinous night being rove over those wretches.

How princes displayed then their prowess-in-battle.

From many a people their mead-benches tore.

The earl had had terror: comfort he got for it,
Waxed ’neath the welkin, world-honor gained,
Till all his neighbors o’er sea were compelled to
Bow to his bidding and bring him their tribute:
An excellent atheling! After was borne him
A son and heir, young in his dwelling,
Whom God-Father sent to solace the people.

                            14. In the 15th century, the Europeans began to exploit the human resources of Africa. The Portuguese French, and English started to bring thousands of slaves back to mainland Europe and America, they were bought and sold like objects so they could work in plantations and serve their masters. This came to be known as the Atlantic Slave Trade. However, this commercial enterprise did not go an antislavery letter unchallenged as calls for abolition soon emerged. The following selection addressed to the Queen of England - is lifted from the autobiography of a prominent 18th century abolitionist. Though this man's birth name was Olaudah Equiano, the letter bears the signature "Gustavus Vassa"- the name given to him by the Royal Navy Officer who "bought" him from the slave trade.Letter to Queen Charlotte To Her Most Excellent Majesty: Your Majesty's well-known benevolence and humanity emboldens me to approach your royal presence, trusting that the obscurity of my situation will not prevent your majesty from attending to the sufferings for which I plead. Yet I do not solicit your royal pity for my own distress; my sufferings although numerous are, in a measure, forgotten. I supplicate your Majesty's compassion for the millions of my African countrymen, who groan under the lash of tyranny in the West Indies. The oppression and cruelty exercised to the unhappy negroes there, have at length reached the British legislature, and they are now deliberating on its redress; even several persons of property in slaves in the West Indies have petitioned parliament against its continuance, sensible that it is as impolitic as it is unjust and what is inhuman must ever be unwise. Your Majesty's reign has been hitherto distinguished by private acts of benevolence and bounty; surely the more extended the misery is, the greater claim it has to your Majesty's compassion, and the greater must be your Majesty's pleasure in administering to its relief. I presume, therefore, gracious Queen, to implore your interposition with your royal consort, in favour of the wretched Africans; that, by your Majesty's benevolent influence, a period may now be put to their misery; and that they may be raised from the condition of brutes to which they are at present degraded to the rights and situation of freemen, and admitted to partake of the blessings of your Majesty's happy government; so shall your Majesty enjoy the heartfelt pleasure of procuring happiness to millions, and be rewarded in the grateful prayers of themselves and of their posterity. And may the all-bountiful Creator shower on your Majesty and the Royal Family every blessing that this world can afford, and every fullness of joy which divine revelation has promised us in the next. I am your Majesty's most dutiful and devoted servant to command, No. 53, Baldwin's Gardens. Gustavus Vassa, The Oppressed Ethiopean 15200 h himComprehension Check Answer the following questions: 1.

                        <p>Olaudah <strong>Equiano</strong>, a <strong>prominent abolitionist </strong>in the <strong>18th century</strong> mainly petitioned to help his fellow Africans from the slavery that they were experiencing under the <strong>Atlantic Slave Trade</strong>. He was asking the Queen of England to help his countrymen and give them equal rights as that what the freemen have. He wanted to abolish the system of <strong>slavery </strong>in that century.</p><p></p><p>Equiano implies that the <strong>wretched Africans</strong> were poorly treated, even abused, and treated unfairly. They experience tyranny under the masters they serve. They are oppressed for being negroes.</p><p></p><p>The people which the queen reigned will give her more of their approval because of her benevolence and compassion regarding the plight of the Africans under their slavery. Equiano said that if the queen helped it will bring happiness and blessings to her government, the people in it, and the Africans and their descendants.</p><p></p><p>I think the letter is effective because Equiano repeatedly shows his respect, empathy, and wit while writing the letter. He also used the word benevolence a lot of times which might get the attention and sympathy of the queen. He tried to psychologically, politically, and emotionally speak to the queen.</p><p></p><p>If you would like to learn more about the prejudice against Africans, kindly please take your time to visit this link:https://brainly.ph/question/2872474</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

Dear City, explain your irreverence: in you, rain is a visitor with nowhere to go. Where is the ground that knows only the love of water? What are the passageways to your heart? Pity the water that stays and rises on the streets, pity the water that floods into houses, so dark and filthy and heavy with rats and dead leaves and plastic. How ashamed water is to be what you have made it. What have you done to its beauty, its graceful body in pictures of oceans, its clear face in a glass? We walk home and cannot see our feet in the flood. We forget to thank the gods for their kindness. We look for someone to blame and turn to you, wretched city, because we are men and women of honor, we feed our children three meals a day, we never miss an election. The only explanation is you, dear city. This is the end of our discussion. There is no other culprit.pls summarize this pls ​</h2><br />
