                                            Kindly translate it into Tagalog language!
One of America’s gifts to us is efficiency, the scientific coordination of planning and action, the philosophy of correct and timely execution. Though long schooled in our Oriental disrespect for Time and encouraged, though unwittingly, to expect the Will that causes the palay to grow to also do our work for us, we realize at last that Time is an element to reckon with, that life here and now, being spread thinly over a limited period of years, must be economized and put to some profitable use. 
Our special significance is this realization in the economic life of our people. The bureaucratic system has impressed upon most of us that we must observe punctuality or lose out; that out pay envelop comes to many of us during stated periods of the month and not before or after, although we may spend its content in advance; and that our efficiency of times detrmine our income.</a>

Lisan, a humble fisherman, mysteriously disappears for eight years before returning home. Bhatia, the wife he has left behind, has remarried in the meantime, but there’s more, and something irrepressible for him to reclaim besides her. Lisan has a royal destiny to be fulfilled.
Kathrina Mohd Daud’s The Fisherman King is an epic novel, anchored in the folk traditions of Brunei. It shares fantastical tales and yesteryear stories which blend magic, fate, sacrifice and national history.
Lisan, adopted and raised in the Water Village, was informed early in life that he was of royal descent. The nanny who had told him passed away before he could ask her more questions. Lisan remains haunted by his parentage and past as he grows up. This loss never fades away even when he meets Bhatia, his soulmate, in secondary school (and whom he later marries). Love, and the bond between Lisan and Bhatia seems unbreakable. Yet, she is not able to make him renounce his obsession over investigating his family origins. One day he leaves her and everything behind. Their reunion after eight years is at first uneasy, bittersweet, with a new man now settled in Bhatia’s life.</a>

                                            translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse?

I have noticed that I am quite good in teaching people. I am the tutor in every studying session I do with my friends, except for Filipino subjects, where I ask them questions and elaborating the parts they were confused in, this way of studying also helps me remember better since my memory works best when I am physically speaking. Before reaching to education, I also thought about being a medical technologist or nursing but ultimately settled for education since my family does not have enough money for the other two. But now, since COVID-19 happened, it actually helped cement the decision of being a teacher.</a>

Perhaps in the city, but in the provinces it is a common thing. Mothers usually choosethe heart's choice of their children. That is why so many unfortunate young find themselves tiedto mates they hardly know, at least at the beginning.But Virgil was in luck. His mother fell in love with a girl who was also the silent choice of his ownheart. He had met her a month before and she had smiled at him. He had smiled at her too, buthad lacked the courage to speak to her.His mother took Virgil to the girl's house one afternoon and introduced him to her. After that sheand the girl's mother left them together and went off to talk about some business of their own.Virgil was still very young. Though good-looking and a bit mischievous with the girls at times, hehad never made love to any of them. So now, he sat before the girl, staring out of the windowand desperately trying to think of something to say."A beautiful sunset, is it not?" he finally said stiffly.The girl looked at him, smiled and nodded, saying "Yes" at the same time.He smiled, although there was really nothing to smile at in what either the girl or he had said.Nevertheless, he smiled again. translate in tagalog​</a>

                                            would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</a>

One of America’s gifts to us is efficiency, the scientific coordination of planning and action, the philosophy of correct and timely execution. Though long schooled in our Oriental disrespect for Time and encouraged, though unwittingly, to expect the Will that causes the palay to grow to also do our work for us, we realize at last that Time is an element to reckon with, that life here and now, being spread thinly over a limited period of years, must be economized and put to some profitable use. 
Our special significance is this realization in the economic life of our people. The bureaucratic system has impressed upon most of us that we must observe punctuality or lose out; that out pay envelop comes to many of us during stated periods of the month and not before or after, although we may spend its content in advance; and that our efficiency of times detrmine our income.</h2><br />

Lisan, a humble fisherman, mysteriously disappears for eight years before returning home. Bhatia, the wife he has left behind, has remarried in the meantime, but there’s more, and something irrepressible for him to reclaim besides her. Lisan has a royal destiny to be fulfilled.
Kathrina Mohd Daud’s The Fisherman King is an epic novel, anchored in the folk traditions of Brunei. It shares fantastical tales and yesteryear stories which blend magic, fate, sacrifice and national history.
Lisan, adopted and raised in the Water Village, was informed early in life that he was of royal descent. The nanny who had told him passed away before he could ask her more questions. Lisan remains haunted by his parentage and past as he grows up. This loss never fades away even when he meets Bhatia, his soulmate, in secondary school (and whom he later marries). Love, and the bond between Lisan and Bhatia seems unbreakable. Yet, she is not able to make him renounce his obsession over investigating his family origins. One day he leaves her and everything behind. Their reunion after eight years is at first uneasy, bittersweet, with a new man now settled in Bhatia’s life.</h2><br />

                            10. translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</h2><br />

I have noticed that I am quite good in teaching people. I am the tutor in every studying session I do with my friends, except for Filipino subjects, where I ask them questions and elaborating the parts they were confused in, this way of studying also helps me remember better since my memory works best when I am physically speaking. Before reaching to education, I also thought about being a medical technologist or nursing but ultimately settled for education since my family does not have enough money for the other two.

                            13. Virgil was only seventeen years old - still young but his mother thought he was old enough, soshe courted a girl for him.Strange? Perhaps in the city, but in the provinces it is a common thing. Mothers usually choosethe heart's choice of their children. That is why so many unfortunate young find themselves tiedto mates they hardly know, at least at the beginning.But Virgil was in luck. His mother fell in love with a girl who was also the silent choice of his ownheart. He had met her a month before and she had smiled at him. He had smiled at her too, buthad lacked the courage to speak to her.His mother took Virgil to the girl's house one afternoon and introduced him to her. After that sheand the girl's mother left them together and went off to talk about some business of their own.Virgil was still very young. Though good-looking and a bit mischievous with the girls at times, hehad never made love to any of them. So now, he sat before the girl, staring out of the windowand desperately trying to think of something to say."A beautiful sunset, is it not?" he finally said stiffly.The girl looked at him, smiled and nodded, saying "Yes" at the same time.He smiled, although there was really nothing to smile at in what either the girl or he had said.Nevertheless, he smiled again. translate in tagalog​</h2><br />

                            14. would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</h2><br />
