Guide QuestionsWhat do you notice with the flow of lines being formed?Which melody has a wider movement of music notes and which one has a closer note movement?On a wider scale, National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA’s) Felipe M. De Leon, in his article about the Diversity of Philippine Music Cultures mentioned some contrasting features of Ilocanos’ and the Visayans’ art forms. Ilocanos prefer the movement of their music to be closer (conjunct) while the Visayans like it farther (disjunct). Ilocano dances have inward hand and arms movement while the Visayans have outward gestures. These intriguing polar artistic characteristics of the two subcultures may have rooted from their own natural values, the Ilocanos’ reserve attitude and the Visayans’ being highly-spirited; the Ilocanos’ survival instinct and the Visayans’ jubilant nature.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.)</p><p></p><p>If a war were to happen in the Philippines, it would be declared by the President of the Philippines. The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and is responsible for maintaining the national security and defending the country.</p><p></p><p>The President has the authority to declare war if the country is under attack, or if there is a threat to the sovereignty or territorial integrity of the Philippines. The President may also declare war if the country is facing an imminent danger, or when there is a need to protect Filipinos abroad. It is up to the President to determine whether or not a war should be declared, and he or she has the power to do so.</p><p></p><p>The Constitution of the Philippines also states that the Congress has the authority to declare war, provided that the declaration is approved by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate. This means that the President would need the support of the Congress should he or she decide to declare war.</p><p></p><p>It is important to note that the decision to declare war is a serious one, and it should not be taken lightly. The consequences of declaring war can be far-reaching and devastating, both for the people of the Philippines and for the country as a whole. If a war were to happen in the Philippines, the President and the Congress must consider the potential ramifications before deciding to go to war.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>The military is a unique political institution and is characterized by a number of distinct features. One of the most important features of the military is its hierarchical structure. This structure is based on rank and authority, with officers and enlisted personnel occupying different positions within the chain of command. At the top of the hierarchy are the highest-ranking officers, who are responsible for making major decisions and strategy for the military. This hierarchical structure is essential for the efficient functioning of the military, as it ensures that orders are followed and that discipline is maintained.</p><p></p><p>Another important feature of the military is its non-partisan nature. The military is apolitical, meaning that it is not affiliated with any particular political party or ideology. This neutrality ensures that the military can serve to protect the nation’s interests without being influenced by partisan politics.</p><p></p><p>The military is also highly organized and disciplined. This is essential in order to ensure that it can quickly and effectively respond to threats and conflicts. The organization of the military also ensures that resources are used efficiently and that personnel are adequately trained and prepared for their roles.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the military is a professional institution. This means that military personnel are highly trained and experienced in the use of weapons and tactics. The professionalism of the military ensures that it is well-equipped to handle a wide range of tasks, from peacekeeping operations to combat operations.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the military is a unique political institution that is characterized by its hierarchical structure, non-partisan nature, organization and discipline, and professionalism. These features ensure that the military remains an effective tool for protecting the nation’s interests.</p><br />

The <strong>exosphere</strong> is the most distant atmospheric region from Earth's surface.</p><p>2. The<strong> ionosphere </strong>stretches roughly 50 to 400 miles above Earth's surface, right at the edge of space.

The puffed-up<strong> thermosphere </strong>increases drag on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites</p><p>6. <strong>Troposphere.</strong> The troposphere is the lowest layer of our atmosphere. Starting at ground level, it extends upward to about 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above sea level.

                            15. Activity 2Listening Activity! Guide QuestionsWhat do you notice with the flow of lines being formed?Which melody has a wider movement of music notes and which one has a closer note movement?On a wider scale, National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA’s) Felipe M. De Leon, in his article about the Diversity of Philippine Music Cultures mentioned some contrasting features of Ilocanos’ and the Visayans’ art forms. Ilocanos prefer the movement of their music to be closer (conjunct) while the Visayans like it farther (disjunct). Ilocano dances have inward hand and arms movement while the Visayans have outward gestures. These intriguing polar artistic characteristics of the two subcultures may have rooted from their own natural values, the Ilocanos’ reserve attitude and the Visayans’ being highly-spirited; the Ilocanos’ survival instinct and the Visayans’ jubilant nature. TRANSFERAfter listening to the audio sample provided, try to answer the following questions. 1. What do you notice about the melody? What instrument played it? 2. How about the mood of the pieces? How can you say that it shows a happy mood, a sad mood, a relax mood, a playful mood, a patriotic mood? 3. Suppose all the instruments will only play the melody of the piece, what do you think will be your general impression about the piece? 4. How does the dynamics of the piece affect its overall sound? Which is better, a piece with dynamics or without dynamics? Why? 5. If ever you will choose your rondalla instrument, what will it be? Why? 6.

                            16. Lumban Style of Embroidery This is where the distinction comes from. We boast a broad selection of intricate hand thread work styles that are preserved by our artisans. The thread work styles that we use are hand- picked to bring the decorative details to perfection. This one-of-a-kind feature dramatically adds character to each piece that we create. THE CALADO Calado (or Callado) is a distinctive feature of our Barong Tagalog. This is a well-known Lumban style of embroidery (Burdang Lumban) in which the fibers are pulled out from the fabric to reduce the fiber count and the remaining intact fibers are then stitched together into a variety of open thread work patterns. https://www.heritagebarong.com/pages/barong-tagalog-embroidery Post Activity Questions: 1.
