Actually, the Paombong word was derived from bumbong (a container made of bamboo). The old way of fermenting the vinegar (suka) was through this container. Sukang Paombong is one of the well-known products of Bulacan. Paombong has a vast plantation of sasâ or nipa palm. This plant is usually found along the estuary where salt water and fresh water flow. From its matured (bungang sasa) nipa palm fruits, these fruits are being spurned for one week to produce more juice and it is locally termed as pagsikad. First, tuba gatherers (manunubâ) used sharp knife to grate the end bent of the sasâ branch. Second, a bumbong will be used as the container of the sasâ juice when it comes out. Next, gathered sasâ juice will be transferred into a large container called "tapayan" (earthen jar) after two or three weeks of that process. Then, they will use a strainer to eliminate the dregs from the juice. Finally, after weeks of fermenting the vinegar in the container, sukang Paombong will be tasted and now is ready to be arranged right in your dining table.Tittle__________Author___________Setting___________Characters___________Event/s__________Theme_________nonsense report​</a>

A Sour Process                  Jon-Jon Surio Reyes Suka is the tagalog term for vinegar and Paombong is a place in Bulacan where earlier Spaniards named the town because of its huge area planted with bamboo. Actually, the Paombong word was derived from bumbong (a container made of bamboo). The old way of fermenting the vinegar (suka) was through this container. Sukang Paombong is one of the well-known products of Bulacan. Paombong has a vast plantation of sasâ or nipa palm. This plant is usually found along the estuary where salt water and fresh water flow. From its matured (bungang sasa) nipa palm fruits, these fruits are being spurned for one week to produce more juice and it is locally termed as pagsikad. First, tuba gatherers (manunubâ) used sharp knife to grate the end bent of the sasâ branch. Second, a bumbong will be used as the container of the sasâ juice when it comes out. Next, gathered sasâ juice will be transferred into a large container called "tapayan" (earthen jar) after two or three weeks of that process. Then, they will use a strainer to eliminate the dregs from the juice. Finally, after weeks of fermenting the vinegar in the container, sukang Paombong will be tasted and now is ready to be arranged right in your dining table.Tittle__________Author___________Setting___________Characters___________Event/s__________Theme_________nonsense report​</h2><br />

                        Tandaan na hindi mo pipiliin, pinipili ka ng pag-ibig. Lahat na maaari mong gawin ay tanggapin ito para sa lahat ng misteryo nito pagdating sa iyong buhay. Huwag mag-alala kung pinupuno ka sa pag-apaw. Pagkatapos ay umabot ka at ibalik ito. Ibigay ito pabalik sa taong nagdala nito sa iyo. Ibigay mo ito sa iba na mahihirap sa espiritu. Ibigay mo ito sa mundo sa paligid mo sa anumang paraan na maaari mong. Ito ay kung saan maraming mga nagmamahal ay nagkamali. Matagal na walang pagmamahal, nauunawaan nila ang pag-ibig tanging bilang isang pangangailangan. Nakita niya ang kanilang mga puso bilang walang laman na mga lugar na mapupuno ng pagmamahal, at nagsisimula silang magmukhang isang bagay, na dumadaloy sa kanila sa halip na para sa kanila. Ang unang pamumula ng pagmamahal ay napuno sa pag-aapoy, ngunit habang ang kanilang pag-ibig ay cools , nagbabalik sila sa pagtingin, ang kanilang pag-ibig bilang pangangailangan. Tiyak na maging isang taong gumagawa ng pag-ibig at sa halip ay maging isang taong naghahanap ng pag-ibig. Nakalimutan nila na ang lihim ng loveis, na ito ay isang regalo, na maaari itong gawin upang lumago lamang sa pamamagitan ng pagbibigay nito.<br />
