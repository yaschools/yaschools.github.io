                                            - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

                                            So, what do you notice with each pair in every item? If you say that they show relationships, then you are correct The term that means "word relationships" is called Analogy. It is like a word puzzle. It always contains two pairs of words. It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</a>

- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

Wel, you are both right," Andrew said. But I think we should not ignore him just becaus he is different from us. I do not think it is right to judge him before we even try to ma friends with him. So, what are we waiting for? Let's go and invite him now to join us! lunch, Andrew eagerly asked. All together, the three of them approached Jose and greeted him, would you like to join us for lunch?

" Yes, we are inviting you for lunch, "the three boys replied in unison. " Oh, yes, I would like to join!" Jose immediately replied. From then on Jose became happy as he was frequently invited by the three boys to join the group. They became friends, and they all played and ate together.1. Who was the transferee in grade four?2.

                            6. - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

                            8. So, what do you notice with each pair in every item? If you say that they show relationships, then you are correct The term that means "word relationships" is called Analogy. It is like a word puzzle. It always contains two pairs of words. It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</h2><br />

                            9. - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

He may not understand us in invite him to join our group." Paolo immediately replied. He may not enjoy the same thing that we enjoy as Manileños, Miguel, another classmate of Andrew, added. Wel, you are both right," Andrew said. But I think we should not ignore him just becaus he is different from us. I do not think it is right to judge him before we even try to ma friends with him. So, what are we waiting for? Let's go and invite him now to join us! lunch, Andrew eagerly asked. All together, the three of them approached Jose and greeted him, would you like to join us for lunch? Jose was so surprised that he was not able to reply at once. After a couple of seconds, he smiled and said, Oh, hi! Are you really inviting me for lunch? Jose timidly asked? " Yes, we are inviting you for lunch, "the three boys replied in unison. " Oh, yes, I would like to join!" Jose immediately replied. From then on Jose became happy as he was frequently invited by the three boys to join the group. They became friends, and they all played and ate together.1. Who was the transferee in grade four?2.

                        <p>Answer:Yes</p><p>Well, in a sense, God gives me second chances every day. He’s given me new life and a chance to live it to serve him. And he forgives me for sinning and messing up when he has every right to take that life away.</p><p></p><p>But I assume you mean if I could go back in time and redo some part of my life.</p><p></p><p>While there are many things I would love to change, I would be very hesitant to do so. Why? Because I have no idea what effect that would have on the rest of me or on the world as a whole. Have you heard of the butterfly effect? The idea behind it is basically that every single occurrence, no matter how small, works together with all the other tiny occurrences to produce various effects. The slightest change in any one of those occurrences could result in a totally different effect. So a single butterfly flapping its wings in South Africa, and the tiny change that makes in the surrounding air, could be the difference between a hurricane in Florida and a gentle breeze, based on its interaction over time with all the other tiny changes in the air.</p><p></p><p>The same principle, I think, would apply to my own actions. If I changed something I did in 2008, even something small, it could result in a disastrous effect on other people around me and on myself. It could also change things for the better. But since I believe God is in control and has directed or permitted things in my life — whether my own actions or the actions of others — that will shape me into the person he wants me to be, I do not think I would want to override that. So ultimately, though there are many things I would want to change, I think I would ultimately choose not to change them.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Hope it helps po :))</p><p>Pa brainliest nman pow! :D</p><br />
