                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. it is all about the submitting their compromise agreement.</p><p>2. the writer's goal in writing an ex-parte motion for extension to submit compromise agreement is to persuade the port to grant an extension (more time needed). An ex-parte motion means the lawyer is pleading on behalf of one party or an outside party. An compromise agreement, on other hand is an extra-judicial agreement where two or more parties will agree on terms that is both acceptable to them.This then lessens the case for litigation or court interventions.</p><p>3. the target of the text is the Defendant.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><br />
