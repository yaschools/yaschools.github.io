"They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" I nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, "ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's "You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their stout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "llaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed.help me 1-5 ​</a>

                            3. how are we going to cope-up with those natural haggards?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ways to cope with natural disasters</p><p></p><p>Seek out and connect with social support. Research has consistently found that early intervention, resources, and support from others can be a major factor in helping people overcome the negative effects of a traumatic event.2﻿ Given that a natural disaster can impact an entire community, your support system may be weakened by a natural disaster. However, even connecting with one person can make a difference.</p><p>Identify local support groups or available crisis counselors to talk to. After a natural disaster, crisis counselors may be brought in to offer support and help you come up with ways of coping with the impact of a natural disaster. Take advantage of these opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Try to establish a schedule. For example, set regular times for meals, waking up in the morning, or talking with family and friends. A natural disaster can greatly disrupt your regular schedule increasing the extent to which your life feels chaotic and out of control. Coming up with a daily, structured schedule can help you establish a sense of predictability and control.3﻿</p><p>Talk about the effect of the natural disaster. Share your feelings with others, or at the very least, find some way to express your emotions. A natural disaster can result in strong feelings of anger, anxiety, and sadness. These emotions need to be expressed. If you hold them in, they may get more intense.</p><p>Focus on self-care. A natural disaster can deplete you physically as well as emotionally. It is very important that you make time to care for yourself. Self-care is integral to emotional and physical health. Caring for your body, mind, and spirit can increase your ability to cope with trauma. Make sure you eat well, get enough sleep, and exercise. Mindfulness practice has also been shown to help survivors cope with PTSD.4﻿</p><p>Practice healthy coping strategies. Following a natural disaster, you will experience a number of intense negative emotions. Therefore, it is very important to identify healthy ways of managing these emotions. Alcohol or substance use, excessive sleep, and seeking comfort in food can be effective short-term strategies for managing emotional distress, but in the long-term, these behaviors don't address the root issue and often increase distress.5﻿</p><p>Try to limit other sources of stress in your life. Although you may have little control over other sources of stress in your life, try to limit the extent to which you make major decisions or life changes. Your most important task following a natural disaster is getting your life and emotions back in order. Therefore, it is important to put yourself in a place where it is going to be easier to do this.</p><p>Find ways to help others. Helping others can provide you with a sense of agency, purpose, control, and empowerment.6﻿</p><p></p><br />

"They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" I nagged myself.

There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their stout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine.
