It delights. It comforts. It thrills. Who doesn't want a warmth of a loving hug? Just like words, hugs speak volumes. They can mean "I miss you," "Bye," "I care," "1 love you." "It's OK," "I forgive," "I'm so proud of you!" In victory celebrations, in trying times, or in hours of bereavement, kiss is not the need of the hour. It is the hug that matters most.. A hug costs nothing. But it is a great gift to give on any occasion. No need to shop for it or bother about size or length or width. All you need is to open your arms wide and wrap the person inside them. And no matter how long or how short your arms are, hugs are always a perfect fit. And what so nice about giving a hug? You can get one in return. A hug goes beyond physical contact. It encompasses compassion, love, forgiveness, and care. "A hug delights and warms, and charms that must be why God gave us arms," so goes the quotation. So with arms wide open, why not go out and hug someone today? But first, here's my big, big, hug.

                            30. Directions: The election does not contain a topic sentence; hence you need to understand the selection to infer its main idea. What can a hug do? It delights. It comforts. It thrills. Who doesn't want a warmth of a loving hug? Just like words, hugs speak volumes. They can mean "I miss you," "Bye," "I care," "1 love you." "It's OK," "I forgive," "I'm so proud of you!" In victory celebrations, in trying times, or in hours of bereavement, kiss is not the need of the hour. It is the hug that matters most.. A hug costs nothing. But it is a great gift to give on any occasion. No need to shop for it or bother about size or length or width. All you need is to open your arms wide and wrap the person inside them. And no matter how long or how short your arms are, hugs are always a perfect fit. And what so nice about giving a hug? You can get one in return. A hug goes beyond physical contact. It encompasses compassion, love, forgiveness, and care. "A hug delights and warms, and charms that must be why God gave us arms," so goes the quotation. So with arms wide open, why not go out and hug someone today? But first, here's my big, big, hug.
