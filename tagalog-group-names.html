                                            A plethora of terms has come to be associated with modern-day public relations practice. Because of the disreputable beginnings of public relations that we will briefly discuss next, it is often the case that organizations will choose to name their public relations function by another moniker. These various terms create much confusion about the responsibilities of public relations versus overlapping or competing organizational functions. The term corporate communication is the most common synonym for public relations in practice today, Bowen et al. (2006). followed by marketing communication and public affairs. We view the term corporate communication as a synonym for public relations, although some scholars argue that corporate communication only applies to for-profit organizations. However, we view corporate communication as a goal-oriented communication process that can be applied not only in the business world but also in the world of nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations, educational foundations, activist groups, faith-based organizations, and so on. The term public relations often leads to confusion between the media relations function, public affairs, corporate communication, and marketing promotions, leading many organizations to prefer the term corporate communication.  baka may alam mag Tagalog neto​</a>

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America.

Pauline : Tama ka. Iyan din ang ulo ng balita sa telebisyon kagabi. Nagsasagawa na ng contact tracing o paghahanap sa mga taong nakasalamuha ng pasyente ang Kagawaran ng Kalusugan katuwang ang iba pang ahensya ng pamahalaan. Pinag-iingat na ang ating mga kababayan upang maiwasan ang pagdami ng kaso.

                            6. A plethora of terms has come to be associated with modern-day public relations practice. Because of the disreputable beginnings of public relations that we will briefly discuss next, it is often the case that organizations will choose to name their public relations function by another moniker. These various terms create much confusion about the responsibilities of public relations versus overlapping or competing organizational functions. The term corporate communication is the most common synonym for public relations in practice today, Bowen et al. (2006). followed by marketing communication and public affairs. We view the term corporate communication as a synonym for public relations, although some scholars argue that corporate communication only applies to for-profit organizations. However, we view corporate communication as a goal-oriented communication process that can be applied not only in the business world but also in the world of nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations, educational foundations, activist groups, faith-based organizations, and so on. The term public relations often leads to confusion between the media relations function, public affairs, corporate communication, and marketing promotions, leading many organizations to prefer the term corporate communication.  baka may alam mag Tagalog neto​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang isang kalabisan ng mga termino ay naiugnay sa modernong-araw na kasanayan sa relasyon sa publiko. Dahil sa hindi magandang pagsisimula ng mga relasyon sa publiko na tatalakayin natin sa madaling sabi, kadalasang pipiliin ng mga organisasyon na pangalanan ang kanilang tungkulin sa relasyon sa publiko ng ibang moniker. Ang iba't ibang terminong ito ay lumilikha ng maraming kalituhan tungkol sa mga responsibilidad ng mga relasyon sa publiko kumpara sa magkakapatong o nakikipagkumpitensyang mga tungkulin ng organisasyon. Ang terminong corporate communication ay ang pinakakaraniwang kasingkahulugan para sa public relations sa praktika ngayon, Bowen et al. (2006). sinusundan ng komunikasyon sa marketing at pampublikong gawain. Tinitingnan namin ang terminong corporate communication bilang kasingkahulugan para sa public relations, bagama't ang ilang mga iskolar ay nangangatwiran na ang corporate communication ay nalalapat lamang sa mga for-profit na organisasyon. Gayunpaman, tinitingnan namin ang corporate communication bilang isang proseso ng komunikasyon na nakatuon sa layunin na maaaring ilapat hindi lamang sa mundo ng negosyo kundi pati na rin sa mundo ng mga nonprofit at non-governmental na organisasyon, educational foundations, aktibistang grupo, faith-based na organisasyon, at iba pa. Ang terminong public relations ay kadalasang humahantong sa kalituhan sa pagitan ng media relations function, public affairs, corporate communication, at marketing promotions, na humahantong sa maraming organisasyon na mas gusto ang terminong corporate communication.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Maraming termino ang nauugnay sa modernong pagpapraktis ng relasyon sa publiko.

Tinatawag namin ang terminong "corporate communication" na katumbas ng relasyon sa publiko, bagaman may ilang mananaliksik na nagtutol na ang corporate communication ay sumasakop lamang sa mga organisasyon na may layunin sa kita.

Ang terminong relasyon sa publiko ay nagdudulot ng kalituhan sa pagitan ng funksyon ng media relations, public affairs, corporate communication, at marketing promotions, na nag-udyok sa maraming organisasyon na mapili ang terminong corporate communication.</p><br />

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</h2><br />

Pagsasalaysay sa Napakinggang Balita 
Nakaumpok ang magkakaklaseng Allen, Pauline, Majen at Isabel sa playground ng kanilang paaralan. Hawak ni Allen ang pahayagang Tagalog at masusing binasa niya ang balita sa araw na iyon. 
Allen : Naku! tingnan ninyo ang headline ngayon. Nakapasok at naitala na raw sa ating bansa ang unang kaso ng bagong coronavirus. (Pasalaysay)___________________________________________ 
Pauline : Tama ka. Iyan din ang ulo ng balita sa telebisyon kagabi. Nagsasagawa na ng contact tracing o paghahanap sa mga taong nakasalamuha ng pasyente ang Kagawaran ng Kalusugan katuwang ang iba pang ahensya ng pamahalaan. Pinag-iingat na ang ating mga kababayan upang maiwasan ang pagdami ng kaso. 
(Patanong) _____________________________________________ 
Isabel : Ganyan din ang paksa sa napakinggan naming balita sa radyo. Inirerekomenda na ang pansamantalang pagtigil ng biyahe sa mga paliparan bilang pag-iingat sa banta ng corona virus. Binubuo na rin daw ang task group ng mga kinatawan na mamumuno dito. 
(Padamdam) ____________________________________________ 
Majen : Naglibot nga kagabi ang mga namumuno sa aming barangay. Nakiusap sila na kung maaari ay manatili na lamang kami sa loob ng aming tahanan lalo na kung walang mahalagang gagawin sa labas. (Pautos)________________________________________________ 
Allen : Talagang maugong ang balita ukol sa kumakalat na sakit na ito. Mahalagang sundin natin ang payo ng mga otoridad upang makaiwas tayo rito. Ang kalinisan ng ating kapaligiran at katawan gayundin ang pagkain ng masusustansyang pagkain ay makatutulong upang lumakas ang ating resistensya. 
Biglang lumapit sa kanila si Eric. 
Eric : (Pakiusap) ____________________________________________ Pinatatawag ang ating grupo ni Gng. Dionisio. Halika na kayo sa ating silid-aralan.

" Yes, we are inviting you for lunch, "the three boys replied in unison. " Oh, yes, I would like to join!" Jose immediately replied.
