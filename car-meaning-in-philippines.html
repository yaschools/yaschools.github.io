Average rate and speed Speed pertains to how fast something is going. We can also say that speed is the rate that a distance can be covered in a certain amount of time. For example, if you are walking slowly, your speed is probably about 5 km per hour. This means that in 1 hour, you are able to cover 5 kilometers in the Philippines, speed is recorded in kph or kilometer per hour. Thus, if the speed is 60kph, this means that the car covers a distance of 60 km in one hour. Average speed is the total distance travelled per total time taken.​</a>

                                            CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.

                                            CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.

Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</a>

Average rate and speed Speed pertains to how fast something is going. We can also say that speed is the rate that a distance can be covered in a certain amount of time. For example, if you are walking slowly, your speed is probably about 5 km per hour. This means that in 1 hour, you are able to cover 5 kilometers in the Philippines, speed is recorded in kph or kilometer per hour. Thus, if the speed is 60kph, this means that the car covers a distance of 60 km in one hour. Average speed is the total distance travelled per total time taken.​</h2><br />

                            8. CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.

                            28. CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.

                            30. 1. Read the provided essay.
2. Create a critique of the topic and evaluate whether or not the text is worth sharing
with other people.
Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The topic presented is a personal opinion on the pros and cons of owning a car in the Philippines. The writer discusses the inconvenience of relying on public transportation and the benefits of owning a car. They acknowledge the financial burden that comes with owning a car but believe that the additional expense is worth the benefits it provides.</p><p></p><p>While the writer's personal experience and perspective are valid, the article could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the issue. For instance, the article does not consider the environmental impact of owning a car, which is a significant concern in the modern world. Additionally, the writer does not consider alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or motorcycles, which could provide similar benefits at a lower cost.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the article lacks statistical evidence or research to back up the claims made, which would have added credibility to the author's opinion. The writer could have provided additional sources and data to support their argument and provide a more well-rounded view of the topic.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the article provides a personal opinion on owning a car in the Philippines, but it lacks a thorough analysis of the issue. It could benefit from more research and evidence to support the author's perspective. However, the topic is still worth sharing with others as it can initiate a conversation on the pros and cons of owning a car and encourage people to consider alternative modes of transportation.</p><br />
