                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the novel "Noli Me Tangere" by Dr. Jose Rizal, Sisa is the mother of Crispin and Basilio. She is portrayed as a kind and loving mother who is deeply concerned about her children's welfare. However, due to the abuse and mistreatment that she and her children have suffered, she develops delusional and mood disorders that affect her behavior and actions.</p><p></p><p>Sisa's delusional disorder is characterized by her persistent belief that she is being pursued by evil spirits. She often hears voices and sees visions of demons and monsters that torment her. This disorder causes her to become extremely fearful and paranoid, leading her to withdraw from society and isolate herself from others.</p><p></p><p>Sisa's mood disorder is exemplified by her periods of depression and hopelessness. She is deeply saddened by the plight of her children and the injustices that they have suffered. Her depression is compounded by her delusional beliefs, which cause her to feel hopeless and powerless.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Sisa's actuations in the novel reflect the devastating effects of poverty, abuse, and mistreatment on mental health. Her delusional and mood disorders illustrate the profound psychological trauma that can result from social and economic oppression</p><br />
