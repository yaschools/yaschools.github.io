There was once a slave who was treated cruelly by his master. One day, he couldn't take it anymore and ran away to the forest to escape. There he chanced upon a lion who couldn't walk because of the thorn in its paw. Although he's scared, the slave mustered his courage and took out the thorn in the lion's paw. When the lion was finally free of the thorn, he ran into the forest and didn't harm the slave. Sometime later, the slave was caught by his master along with some animals in the forest. The master then ordered the slave to be thrown into the lion's den. When the slave saw the lion, he recognized it as the same lion he helped in the forest. The slave was able to escape the den unharmed and he freed all the other animals.

                                            A JUNE 12 THOUGHT: RESPECT FLAG RITES A flag ceremony, wherever it be a flag raising or a flag retreat is sacred. Therefore, it should be observed with all the solemnity and sacredness a Filipino citizen can muster. The National Anthem (Pambansang Awit), like the national flag, should be treated with ceremonial respect. On this anniversary of the declaration of Independent in Kawit in 1898 it is perhaps timely to remind all and to behave during flag ceremonies. Sad to say, many students during the Monday morning flag raising ceremonies, instead of standing at attention while singing the National Anthem, and while reciting the Patriotic Fledge (Panatang Makabayan), move around play and have completely disregarding what’s going on. It is for this reasons that we are calling the attention of all teachers, especially the social studies teachers to give more emphasis on teaching values, love of country, respect for the flag, veneration of heroes, and proper behavior during flag ceremonies. In flag ceremonies cannot be held properly, why then do we hold them all.a.Editorisl of Special occasion     b. Editorial of Criticism     c. Editorial of Commendation       d.

                                            “IF I WERE”. Addressing widespread poverty is the single most important policy challenge facing the Philippines. Not only is poverty high when benchmarked against countries in Asia, but also the rate of poverty reduction has been slow. While the Philippine economy has grown at an average of 6 percent for the last five consecutive quarters (since 2012), poverty incidence remains above 20 percent of the population. The critical challenge is to spread the payback of this huge economic turnaround among the people, especially the poorest of the poor. They should feel the benefits of the growing Philippine economy. In this portion of the unit, you will be required to demonstrate your depth understanding on the importance of entrepreneurship and the growing economy of the Philippines. What is the task? Hypothetically speaking, If you were the president of the Philippines what have you envision with our government, economy and to your people? As a political and economic leader, what are your moves/plans to accelerate the economic development and that muster social reforms through entrepreneurship  (1)You have to create an Economic Development Plan for your country. (2) Discuss the benefit it could give to your government, to the economy and specifically to your people.  To counter the challenges that the country is facing specifically in terms of economy, remember Entrepreneurs have the power to achieve great things. More so, Entrepreneurs will emerge as the well-oiled wheels that will keep the economy going and the society efficiently running. (3) Make a realistic Economic Development Plan​</a>

                            24. The Lion and the Poor Slave
There was once a slave who was treated cruelly by his master. One day, he couldn't take it anymore and ran away to the forest to escape. There he chanced upon a lion who couldn't walk because of the thorn in its paw. Although he's scared, the slave mustered his courage and took out the thorn in the lion's paw. When the lion was finally free of the thorn, he ran into the forest and didn't harm the slave. Sometime later, the slave was caught by his master along with some animals in the forest. The master then ordered the slave to be thrown into the lion's den. When the slave saw the lion, he recognized it as the same lion he helped in the forest. The slave was able to escape the den unharmed and he freed all the other animals.

                            26. A JUNE 12 THOUGHT: RESPECT FLAG RITES A flag ceremony, wherever it be a flag raising or a flag retreat is sacred. Therefore, it should be observed with all the solemnity and sacredness a Filipino citizen can muster. The National Anthem (Pambansang Awit), like the national flag, should be treated with ceremonial respect. On this anniversary of the declaration of Independent in Kawit in 1898 it is perhaps timely to remind all and to behave during flag ceremonies. Sad to say, many students during the Monday morning flag raising ceremonies, instead of standing at attention while singing the National Anthem, and while reciting the Patriotic Fledge (Panatang Makabayan), move around play and have completely disregarding what’s going on. It is for this reasons that we are calling the attention of all teachers, especially the social studies teachers to give more emphasis on teaching values, love of country, respect for the flag, veneration of heroes, and proper behavior during flag ceremonies. In flag ceremonies cannot be held properly, why then do we hold them all.a.Editorisl of Special occasion     b. Editorial of Criticism     c. Editorial of Commendation       d.

                            27. “IF I WERE”. Addressing widespread poverty is the single most important policy challenge facing the Philippines. Not only is poverty high when benchmarked against countries in Asia, but also the rate of poverty reduction has been slow. While the Philippine economy has grown at an average of 6 percent for the last five consecutive quarters (since 2012), poverty incidence remains above 20 percent of the population. The critical challenge is to spread the payback of this huge economic turnaround among the people, especially the poorest of the poor. They should feel the benefits of the growing Philippine economy. In this portion of the unit, you will be required to demonstrate your depth understanding on the importance of entrepreneurship and the growing economy of the Philippines. What is the task?

There are clear signs of rebounds in domestic activity, community mobility, industrial output, and recently with bank lending activities. However, there are challenges to growth with the continuing threat of the pandemic amid narrowing policy space. The key policy challenges are to protect long term fiscal sustainability, leverage the private sector in the recovery, and limit the economic scarring from the pandemic.<br />
