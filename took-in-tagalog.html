                                            affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the Immortal Laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar has disobeyed the Immortal Laws. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves. Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of the cave, but he could not. He struggled so hard that he shook the walls of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar she would rush out in her golden chariot to the meeting place in the hope of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.  translate in tagalogâ€‹</a>

                                            pls translate to Tagalog/Filipino.It's great that the economy is growing and rebounding back from the hit it took from the COVID-19 pandemic. It's not there yet, but I'm optimistic about the situation.The government's plan to keep up the rise and recover by acceleration of the vaccineprogram is one I'm certainly looking forward to. If this pace continues, we're certainly recover.Further on, oil prices going to be still high or not is certainly another thing to watch out for, which the chief of the Natural Economic and Development authority said the country will be doing. They're saying they have it if it does go up, as I have no idea what they're talking about I'm going to trust them. Moving forward, Both industry and service sectors growing is positive, but agriculture growth being impeded and even pushed back by typhoons and the African swine fever is a shame. The rise in gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily driven by household consumption accounting for 5.2 percentage of overall GDP growth is great, I guess I'll have to buy more or something to help the economy.My reaction really isn't much of a reaction, but I certainly hope I'll understand most of these terms by the end of the school year.â€‹</a>

When I was a boy, one of the rules at home that II did not like at all was to be made to lie on the bare floor of our sala after lunch. I usually lay side by side with two other children in the family. We were forced to sleep by my mother. She watched us as she darned old dresses, read an awit, or hummed a cradle song in Tagalog." (from "Siesta", Leopoldo R. Serrano) 47. "The custom of having a siesta was introduced in our country by the Spaniards. Indeed, during the Spanish times, the Philippines was the land of the fiesta, the novena, and the siesta." (Siesta, Leopoldo R. Serrano) 48. "He looked about for a house he could go to and lose his bad feeling. He almost jumped up in delight. He had reached the edge of the barrio and so must be near the house of Mang Tinoy and Aling Nadang. Mang Tinoy was a forester. He took care of the big forest back of Lian. He and Aling Nadang had many children and a cozy, nipa house with big family rooms." (from " A Family for Tomas" by Loreto Paras-Sulit) 49. "Tomas had often spent the night with them when he went to the forest to gather firewood to sell in order to earn a peso or more for himself."

                                            Virgil was only seventeen years old - still young but his mother thought he was old enough, soshe courted a girl for him.Strange? Perhaps in the city, but in the provinces it is a common thing. Mothers usually choosethe heart's choice of their children. That is why so many unfortunate young find themselves tiedto mates they hardly know, at least at the beginning.But Virgil was in luck. His mother fell in love with a girl who was also the silent choice of his ownheart. He had met her a month before and she had smiled at him. He had smiled at her too, buthad lacked the courage to speak to her.His mother took Virgil to the girl's house one afternoon and introduced him to her. After that sheand the girl's mother left them together and went off to talk about some business of their own.Virgil was still very young. Though good-looking and a bit mischievous with the girls at times, hehad never made love to any of them. So now, he sat before the girl, staring out of the windowand desperately trying to think of something to say."A beautiful sunset, is it not?" he finally said stiffly.The girl looked at him, smiled and nodded, saying "Yes" at the same time.He smiled, although there was really nothing to smile at in what either the girl or he had said.Nevertheless, he smiled again. translate in tagalogâ€‹</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>August, 1896, the smouldering fire of discontent burst into flame. At the time of the outhreak of the Tagal Rebellion, General Blanco, the Governor-General, had but ftifteen hundred European troops and six thousand native auxiliaries at bis command. Of the former only seven hundred were in Manila and the loyalty of tlhe latter was doubtful. Under these circumstances the General was forced to confine his operations to the defense of the city, around which several skirmishes took place during the first few months following the inception of the rebellion. Meanwhile the rebels were making good use of the respite. They established their headquarters in Imus, of the province of Cavite, which became the most important center of the rebellion.</p><p>In November Blanco had received from Spain additions to his force, which brought the European contingent up to ten thousand, and he began to extend his operations, but he was recalled before any considerable headway bad been made against the insurrection.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime the prisons of Manila were crowded with natives suspected of sympathy with tlhe insurgents. All process of law was disregarded in their arrests, and their disposition by court-martial was equally summary. This military tribunal is strongly suspected of extortion in collusion with some of the civil authorities. Hundreds of the wealthiest natives and mestizos of Manila were brought before it and many of them are known to have purchased their release, in some instances only to go through the process again in a few weeks' time. Shiploads of prisoners were consigned to the Caroline Islands, Fernando Po, Ceuta, and other penal colonies. The Manila volunteers were allowed to make domiciliary searches without warrant and to perpetrate the worst kind of outrages upon native residents of both sexes. Numbers of suspects were executed without trial and not a few were tortured so that they became cripples for life. In fact, the acts of officials during this reign of terror equaled the deeds of the Inquisition at </p><br />

Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar has disobeyed the Immortal Laws. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves. Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of the cave, but he could not. He struggled so hard that he shook the walls of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar she would rush out in her golden chariot to the meeting place in the hope of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.  translate in tagalogâ€‹</h2><br />

Isinara niya siya sa kanilang hardin at hindi siya pinayagang makalabas. Pagkatapos ay nagpadala siya ng mensahero sa diyos ng dagat na ipinaalam sa kanya na ang kanyang anak na si Mar ay sumuway sa mga Batas na Walang Kamatayan. Ang diyos ng dagat, na nagalit din sa pagsuway ng kanyang anak, ay ikinulong siya sa isa sa kanyang mga kweba ng dagat. Nanatili si Luna sa hardin ng ilang oras. Nalungkot siya nang hindi makita si Mar. Nais niyang makasama itong muli. Pakiramdam niya ay hindi mapakali isang araw, nakatakas siya mula sa hardin. Kinuha niya ang kanyang gintong karwahe at nagmamadaling pumunta sa kanilang tagpuan. Nakita ni Mar, na nakakulong sa kweba ng dagat, ang kanyang repleksyon sa tubig. Gusto niyang lumabas para salubungin siya. Sinubukan niyang makaalis sa kweba, ngunit hindi niya magawa. Nagpumiglas siya kaya niyanig niya ang mga dingding ng kanyang kweba na nagdulot ng kaguluhan sa dagat. Hinintay ni Luna na lumitaw si Mar, ngunit hindi siya dumating. Pagkatapos ay umuwi siyang malungkot. Sa tuwing naaalala niya si Mar ay nagmamadali siyang papalabas sa kanyang gintong kalesa patungo sa tagpuan sa pag-asang makita siyang muli. Naniniwala ang mga mangingisda sa dagat na sa tuwing lilitaw si Luna, ang buwan, nagugulo ang dagat. "Si Mar ay sinusubukang tumakas mula sa kanyang kuweba," sabi nila.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ilang oras ako dito beh sana nahelp kita</p><br />

Kahit na ang reason ng pag inom nila ay para mag saya. Hindi parin sapat yun kasi may iba pa namang paraan na maaari nilang gawin para mag celebrate hindi ang mag inom. At tsaka alam nila na magagalit yung parents nila pag nalaman na uminom sila pero ginawa parin nilang uminom. I can say that this is quite connected with peer pressure.

It's not there yet, but I'm optimistic about the situation.The government's plan to keep up the rise and recover by acceleration of the vaccineprogram is one I'm certainly looking forward to. If this pace continues, we're certainly recover.Further on, oil prices going to be still high or not is certainly another thing to watch out for, which the chief of the Natural Economic and Development authority said the country will be doing. They're saying they have it if it does go up, as I have no idea what they're talking about I'm going to trust them. Moving forward, Both industry and service sectors growing is positive, but agriculture growth being impeded and even pushed back by typhoons and the African swine fever is a shame. The rise in gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily driven by household consumption accounting for 5.2 percentage of overall GDP growth is great, I guess I'll have to buy more or something to help the economy.My reaction really isn't much of a reaction, but I certainly hope I'll understand most of these terms by the end of the school year.â€‹</h2><br />

When I was a boy, one of the rules at home that II did not like at all was to be made to lie on the bare floor of our sala after lunch. I usually lay side by side with two other children in the family. We were forced to sleep by my mother. She watched us as she darned old dresses, read an awit, or hummed a cradle song in Tagalog." (from "Siesta", Leopoldo R. Serrano) 47. "The custom of having a siesta was introduced in our country by the Spaniards. Indeed, during the Spanish times, the Philippines was the land of the fiesta, the novena, and the siesta." (Siesta, Leopoldo R. Serrano) 48. "He looked about for a house he could go to and lose his bad feeling. He almost jumped up in delight. He had reached the edge of the barrio and so must be near the house of Mang Tinoy and Aling Nadang. Mang Tinoy was a forester. He took care of the big forest back of Lian. He and Aling Nadang had many children and a cozy, nipa house with big family rooms." (from " A Family for Tomas" by Loreto Paras-Sulit) 49. "Tomas had often spent the night with them when he went to the forest to gather firewood to sell in order to earn a peso or more for himself."

                            30. Virgil was only seventeen years old - still young but his mother thought he was old enough, soshe courted a girl for him.Strange? Perhaps in the city, but in the provinces it is a common thing. Mothers usually choosethe heart's choice of their children. That is why so many unfortunate young find themselves tiedto mates they hardly know, at least at the beginning.But Virgil was in luck. His mother fell in love with a girl who was also the silent choice of his ownheart. He had met her a month before and she had smiled at him. He had smiled at her too, buthad lacked the courage to speak to her.His mother took Virgil to the girl's house one afternoon and introduced him to her. After that sheand the girl's mother left them together and went off to talk about some business of their own.Virgil was still very young. Though good-looking and a bit mischievous with the girls at times, hehad never made love to any of them. So now, he sat before the girl, staring out of the windowand desperately trying to think of something to say."A beautiful sunset, is it not?" he finally said stiffly.The girl looked at him, smiled and nodded, saying "Yes" at the same time.He smiled, although there was really nothing to smile at in what either the girl or he had said.Nevertheless, he smiled again. translate in tagalogâ€‹</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Labing pitong taong gulang pa lamang si Virgil - bata pa ngunit akala ng kanyang ina ay nasa hustong gulang na siya, kaya</p><p>niligawan niya ang isang babae para sa kanya.</p><p>Kakaiba? Marahil sa lungsod, ngunit sa mga probinsya ito ay isang pangkaraniwang bagay. Karaniwang pinipili ng mga ina</p><p>pinili ng puso ng kanilang mga anak. Kaya naman maraming kapus-palad na kabataan ang nakatali</p><p>sa mga kapareha na halos hindi nila kilala, kahit sa simula.</p><p>Pero maswerte si Virgil. Ang kanyang ina ay umibig sa isang batang babae na siya rin ang tahimik na pinili ng kanyang sarili</p><p>puso. Nakilala niya ito noong isang buwan at ngumiti ito sa kanya. Nakangiti din siya sa kanya, pero</p><p>ay walang lakas ng loob na kausapin siya.</p><p>Dinala ng kanyang ina si Virgil sa bahay ng dalaga isang hapon at ipinakilala ito sa kanya. Pagkatapos niyan</p><p>at iniwan silang magkasama ng ina ng batang babae at umalis upang pag-usapan ang tungkol sa kanilang sariling negosyo.</p><p>Napakabata pa ni Virgil. Kahit na maganda at medyo pilyo sa mga babae minsan, siya</p><p>ay hindi kailanman nakipag-ibigan sa alinman sa kanila. Kaya ngayon, umupo siya sa harap ng babae, nakatingin sa labas ng bintana</p><p>at pilit na nag-iisip ng sasabihin.</p><p>"Isang magandang paglubog ng araw, hindi ba?" matigas na sabi niya sa wakas.</p><p>Tumingin sa kanya ang dalaga, ngumiti at tumango, sabay sabing "Oo".</p><p>Ngumiti siya, although wala naman talagang dapat ngitian sa sinabi ng dalaga o niya.</p><p>Gayunpaman, ngumiti ulit siya.</p><p></p><br />
