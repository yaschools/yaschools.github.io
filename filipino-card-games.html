                            2. Solve this with explanation please. Thank you!
1. Ms. Marj had 40 homework notebooks to check. She was able to check 20% of the notebooks. How many notebooks were not checked?
2. There were 30 Filipinos who participated in a competition. This is 30% of the total number of the participants. How many joined the competition?
3. There were 18 Caviteños who participated in a seminar. This is 9% of the total number of the participants. How many attended the seminar?
4. In a guessing game, Oliver correctly guessed 39 cards out of 52 cards. How many percent did he guess correctly?
5. There are 40 grade 6 students in a class and 90% of them joined the field trip. How many of them did not join?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Ms. Marj checked 40 x 20/100 = 8 notebooks. Therefore, 40 - 8 = 32 notebooks were not checked.</p><p></p><p>2. If there were 30 Filipinos who participated in a competition and they were 30% of the total number of participants, the total number of participants can be found by using the formula: Total participants = 30 / (30/100) = 100 participants.</p><p></p><p>3. If there were 18 Caviteños who participated in a seminar and they were 9% of the total number of participants, the total number of participants can be found by using the formula: Total participants = 18 / (9/100) = 200 participants.</p><p></p><p>4. To find out the percentage of the cards that Oliver correctly guessed, use the formula: Correctly guessed / Total x 100. The result is: 39/52 x 100 = 75%.</p><p></p><p>5. If there were 40 grade 6 students in a class and 90% of them joined the field trip, the number of students who did not join can be found by using the formula: Not joined = 40 x (100-90)/100 = 40 x 10/100 = 4 students.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
