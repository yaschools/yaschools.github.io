A Filipino guy (as depicted wearing salakot and barong tagalog) was trying to stop Santos, telling the latter to stop giving Barcelona the crown because it is not his to begin with.

                                            translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</a>

                                            Learning Task 2 Read "Where's the Patis?" by Carmen Guerrero Nakpil. As you read the selection, STOP when you see a dish illustration and answer the question. What is the great Filipino dream? Where's the Patis? Carmen Guerrero Nakpil A Filipino may denationalize himself but not his stomach. He may travel over the seven seas, the five continents, the two hemispheres and lose the savor of home, forget his identity and believe himself a citizen of the world. But he remains- gastronomically, at least, always c Filipino. For, if in no other way, the Filipino loves his country with his stomach. 2 Travel has become the great Filipino dream. In the same way that an American dreams of becoming a millionaire or an English boy dreams of going to one of the great universities, the Filipino dreams of going abroad. His most constant vision is that of himself as a tourist. * To visit Hongkong, Tokyo and other cities of Asia, perchance or to catch a glimpse of Rome, Paris or London or to go to America (even for only a week in c flyspecked motel in California) is the sum of all delights. 4 Yet having left Manila International Airport in a pink cloud of despedidas and sampaguita garlands and pabilin, the dream turns into a nightmare very quickly. But why? Because the first bastion of the Filipino spirit is the palate. And in all the palaces and fleshpots and skyscrapers of that magic world called "abroad there is no patis to be had Which international cities do Filipinos want to visit the most? 5 Consider the Pinoy abroad. He has discarded the barong tagalog or "polo" for a dark, sleek Western suit. He takes to the habiliments from Hongkong, Brooks Brothers or Savile Row with the greatest of ease. He has also shed the casual informality of manner that is characteristically Filipino. He gives himself the airs of a cosmopolite to the credit card born. He is extravagantly courteous (especially in a borrowed language) and has taken to hand- kissing and to plenty of American "D'you mind's?" How can you describe the "Pinoy" being in a foreign country?​</a>

                            7. translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse?
