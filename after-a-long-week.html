                                            There are many stages on how a baby is formed. Step one of conception is when the sperm penetrates the egg to complete the genetic make up of a human fetus. After 4 weeks, the basic structures of the fetus have begun to develop into separate areas that will form the head, chest, abdomen, and the organs that are contained within them. At 8 weeks, the fetus is about one-half an inch long. (1.1cm). Facial features such as developing ears, eyelids, and nose tip are present. At 12 weeks, the fetus has grown to about 2 inches (4.4cm) in length and may begin to move by itself. At 16 weeks, the fetus is about 4 and one-half inches long and resembles an infant; At twenty weeks, the developing baby is about 6 inches long (13.2 cm) and may weigh about 10 ounces. At 28 weeks, the baby normally weighs about 2 and one-half pounds and has developed to the point that if the baby is birthed prematurely for any reason.

                            12. There are many stages on how a baby is formed. Step one of conception is when the sperm penetrates the egg to complete the genetic make up of a human fetus. After 4 weeks, the basic structures of the fetus have begun to develop into separate areas that will form the head, chest, abdomen, and the organs that are contained within them. At 8 weeks, the fetus is about one-half an inch long. (1.1cm). Facial features such as developing ears, eyelids, and nose tip are present. At 12 weeks, the fetus has grown to about 2 inches (4.4cm) in length and may begin to move by itself. At 16 weeks, the fetus is about 4 and one-half inches long and resembles an infant; At twenty weeks, the developing baby is about 6 inches long (13.2 cm) and may weigh about 10 ounces. At 28 weeks, the baby normally weighs about 2 and one-half pounds and has developed to the point that if the baby is birthed prematurely for any reason.
