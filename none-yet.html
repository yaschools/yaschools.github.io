There is so much more to college than the classes you take. Not only does university help you grow academically and professionally, but also as an individual. That, in my opinion, is a beautiful thing. Here’s what I have learned this semester.</p><p><strong>If none yet, then, how do you encourage and motivate yourself and other people?</strong></p><p>You can only motivate and inspire your team if they know what they are working towards. Make sure your employees are aware of your vision and what your ultimate goals are for the business. This encourages everyone to work together to achieve better results. As well as this, regularly set clear and measurable goals that are framed by this vision so that you and your teams can track progress and they are able to see their success in a tangible way. Supporting alignment within and across teams cultivates increased productivity and can help employees to feel valued and motivated.</p><p>Pa brainliest. done.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The background of the study provides insights to the motivations and perspectives of the researcher.
