                                            What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</a>

                                             pa tagalog plsss Japanese management once attracted global attention It was very difficult for Westerners to understand why employees work so hard for a company. Many observers concluded that Japan must have had some magical 1 t 3 management system. But they were wrong. The Japanese work force has been rooted in a tradition that values diligence. The reason some Japanese enterprises excel is that their employees share this set of values and work hard for the company. In the next decade the new generation, which grew up in more affluent times, will form the majority in the work force, and individualism will come to the forefront. The decline of Japanese companies could thus begin if excessive individualism leads their people to lose 2 appreciation for the value of work. In the United States today, companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which advocates corporate ideals and philosophy, continue to prosper. No company should rely solely on employees' native diligence or traditional values to succeed. We must set forth a company philosophy for our young employees, share with them the real meaning of work, and give them a purpose in life.​</a>

our topic or title or whatever is "The Effects of Fossil Fuel: Is it Harmful to the Environment?"</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Firstly, a defense title is a concise and clear statement that summarizes the main point or argument of your research project. It should be brief and to the point, and provide a clear indication of the purpose and scope of your work. In the case of your topic, "The Effects of Fossil Fuel: Is it Harmful to the Environment?", it seems that your research is focused on examining the environmental impact of the use of fossil fuels.</p><p></p><p>To start, you can break down your title into three key components:</p><p></p><p>The Effects of Fossil Fuel - This part of your title indicates the focus of your research, which is on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source that is extracted from the earth, and include coal, oil, and natural gas.</p><p></p><p>Is it Harmful - This part of your title introduces the central question of your research, which is whether the use of fossil fuels is harmful to the environment. This question can be further refined by identifying specific aspects of the environment that are impacted by the use of fossil fuels, such as air pollution, water pollution, and climate change.</p><p></p><p>To the Environment - This part of your title indicates the scope of your research, which is focused specifically on the environmental impact of fossil fuels. It is important to be clear and specific about the scope of your research in your defense title, as this will help your audience understand the focus of your work.</p><p></p><p>Based on these three key components, you can revise your defense title to make it more concise and clear. Here's an example of a revised defense title:</p><p></p><p>"The Environmental Impact of Fossil Fuels: Assessing the Harmful Effects on Air, Water, and Climate"</p><p></p><p>I hope this helps you to better understand how to craft a defense title for your research project. Good luck with your defense!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            19. What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</h2><br />

                            23.  pa tagalog plsss Japanese management once attracted global attention It was very difficult for Westerners to understand why employees work so hard for a company. Many observers concluded that Japan must have had some magical 1 t 3 management system. But they were wrong. The Japanese work force has been rooted in a tradition that values diligence. The reason some Japanese enterprises excel is that their employees share this set of values and work hard for the company. In the next decade the new generation, which grew up in more affluent times, will form the majority in the work force, and individualism will come to the forefront. The decline of Japanese companies could thus begin if excessive individualism leads their people to lose 2 appreciation for the value of work. In the United States today, companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which advocates corporate ideals and philosophy, continue to prosper. No company should rely solely on employees' native diligence or traditional values to succeed. We must set forth a company philosophy for our young employees, share with them the real meaning of work, and give them a purpose in life.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang pamamahala ng Hapon ay minsang nakaakit ng pandaigdigang atensyon Napakahirap para sa mga Kanluranin na maunawaan kung bakit ang mga empleyado ay nagtatrabaho nang husto para sa isang kumpanya. Napagpasyahan ng maraming tagamasid na ang Japan ay may ilang mahiwagang 1 t 3 na sistema ng pamamahala. Ngunit nagkamali sila. Nag-ugat ang Japanese work force sa isang tradisyon na pinahahalagahan ang kasipagan. Ang dahilan kung bakit napakahusay ng ilang negosyo sa Japan ay dahil ang kanilang mga empleyado ay nagbabahagi ng hanay ng mga halagang ito at nagsusumikap para sa kumpanya. Sa susunod na dekada, ang bagong henerasyon, na lumaki sa mas mayayamang panahon, ay bubuo ng karamihan sa lakas ng trabaho, at ang indibidwalismo ay mauuna. Ang pagbaba ng mga kumpanyang Hapones ay maaaring magsimula kung ang labis na indibidwalismo ay humantong sa kanilang mga tao na mawalan ng pagpapahalaga sa halaga ng trabaho. Sa Estados Unidos ngayon, ang mga kumpanyang tulad ng Hewlett-Packard at IBM, na nagtataguyod ng mga ideyal at pilosopiya ng korporasyon, ay patuloy na umuunlad. Walang kumpanyang dapat umasa lamang sa katutubong kasipagan o tradisyonal na pagpapahalaga ng mga empleyado upang magtagumpay. Dapat tayong magtakda ng pilosopiya ng kumpanya para sa ating mga kabataang empleyado, ibahagi sa kanila ang tunay na kahulugan ng trabaho, at bigyan sila ng layunin sa buhay.</p><br />

                        Answer: ✏<p></p><p><strong>"Love Letter for Mother Earth"</strong></p><p></p><p>We are all aware that Earth is the only planet on which life exists.</p><p>Since of now, it is apparent that this planet has been a gift to us humans and other living things, as it provides us with all of the resources we require. Everything we need is provided by Earth, from air to water to food, which is why we call it Mother Earth. We would not have existed if not for the beauty of the environment and the abundance of resources available on the planet. But, what have we done to our mother earth? We have exploited the earth for our own ends, and now the planet we call our mother faces the threat of extinction of life on its soil due to our bad behavior. Pollution levels are at an all-time high, and resources are rapidly depleting. To save our mother earth, we must take adequate precautions. Every day, we generate tons of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste and dispose of it irresponsibly. She is being suffocated by smoke and harmful gases emitted by our homes, vehicles, and industries. We are recklessly disposing of dirty sewage, drainage, and even chemicals, despite the fact that more than 7 billion humans, as well as all plants and animals on the planet, rely on water for survival. For agriculture and settlement, we destroy forests. We construct massive structures, roads, and factories that exceed her carrying capacity. The construction of nuclear reactors has a significant impact on the environment and human lives. Air pollution causes airborne diseases such as asthma in humans and animals, as well as disrupting the entire metabolism process in plants. In humans, noise pollution causes insomnia and heart disease. Deforestation causes natural disasters such as floods, soil erosion, and so on, as well as temperature rise and altered rainfall distribution, drought, loss of valuable biodiversity, decreased oxygen density, and so on. The world's most pressing issues at the moment are "Climate Change &amp; Greenhouse Effect." Thus, for the sake of our planet's sustainability, I promise to fulfill my responsibilities as a global citizen to Mother Nature in order to protect my living planet from deterioration and to leave a clean and green planet to future generations. Our individual efforts may appear insignificant, but if thousands of young people act together to protect nature, our efforts will one day be a significant step toward protecting our motherland Earth from destruction.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
