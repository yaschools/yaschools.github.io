                                            1. “Mother tongue education refers to any form of schooling that makes use of the language or languages that children are most familiar with. This is usually the language that children speak at home with their family. The ‘mother tongue’ does not have to be the language spoken by the mother. Children can and often do speak more than one or even two languages at home.”
2. “Another way to grasp the concept of animatism is to differentiate the Cebuano terms gahum and kusog. Gahum comes closer to the Tagalog galing, acquired power or skill as in the case of politics, while kusog comes closer to the Tagalog lakas, an almost innate power with connotations of dynamism and energy.”

Myth 4: If X is happy in a particular field, I will be happy too 
Fact: You are not X
Everyone is different and what works for one person won’t necessarily work 
for another, even if that other person is someone with whom you have a lot in 
common. If someone you know has a career that interests you try and get more 
details about the career in terms of the job description, the skills required and market 
demand of the career. Then match the description with your traits and then make a 
choice. Be aware that what you like may not necessarily be a good fit for you</h2><br />
                        Ang tinutukoy ni "X" ay yung mga taong close mo(kaibigan, boyfriend/gilrfriend, at magulang). Ibig sabihin hinid porket masaya si X na nagtatrabaho sa specific job ay magiging masaya ka na rin pag yun ang pinili mong trabaho. Halimbawa: Masaya naman si mama sa pagiging teacher siguro magiging masaya narin ako.<br /><br />Syempre hindi yan totoo kasi may iba't iba tayong gustong ginagawa. Kung kukunin mo yung hindi mo gusto at gusto lang ng iba malaki ang posibilidad na hindi maging maganda nag resulta.<br />

This is usually the language that children speak at home with their family. The ‘mother tongue’ does not have to be the language spoken by the mother. Children can and often do speak more than one or even two languages at home.”
2. “Another way to grasp the concept of animatism is to differentiate the Cebuano terms gahum and kusog. Gahum comes closer to the Tagalog galing, acquired power or skill as in the case of politics, while kusog comes closer to the Tagalog lakas, an almost innate power with connotations of dynamism and energy.”
