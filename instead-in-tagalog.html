                                            They had moved here to the island of Mindoro about a year ago because Julio had been unable to find any land of his own to farm. As it was, he thought himself lucky when Ka Ponso agreed to take him on as a tenant. “Dear Compadre,” he started writing. A while before, his wife had given birth to a baby. Ka Ponso had happened to be in the neighborhood and offered to be the baby’s godfather. After that they had begun to call each other compadre. Julio was writing in Tagalog, bending earnestly over a piece of paper torn out of his son’s school notebook. It was many months since he had had a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the municipal office in Mansalay to file a homestead application. Then he had used a pen and, to his surprise, he had been able to fill in the blank form neatly. Nothing had come of the application, although Ka Ponso had assured him he had looked into the matter and talked with the officials concerned. Now, using a pencil instead of a pen, Julio was sure he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso. Answer the following questions based on the text. 1. Who had moved to the island of Mindoro? 2. Why did they move to the island? 3. How did Ka Ponso help him? 4. How are Ka Ponso and Julio related to each other? 5. What was it that Julio was happy about? 6. What positive characteristics did Julio show in the story? Did you admire him for that? Why, explain your answer.</a>

                        Tandaan na hindi mo pipiliin, pinipili ka ng pag-ibig. Lahat na maaari mong gawin ay tanggapin ito para sa lahat ng misteryo nito pagdating sa iyong buhay. Huwag mag-alala kung pinupuno ka sa pag-apaw. Pagkatapos ay umabot ka at ibalik ito. Ibigay ito pabalik sa taong nagdala nito sa iyo. Ibigay mo ito sa iba na mahihirap sa espiritu. Ibigay mo ito sa mundo sa paligid mo sa anumang paraan na maaari mong. Ito ay kung saan maraming mga nagmamahal ay nagkamali. Matagal na walang pagmamahal, nauunawaan nila ang pag-ibig tanging bilang isang pangangailangan. Nakita niya ang kanilang mga puso bilang walang laman na mga lugar na mapupuno ng pagmamahal, at nagsisimula silang magmukhang isang bagay, na dumadaloy sa kanila sa halip na para sa kanila. Ang unang pamumula ng pagmamahal ay napuno sa pag-aapoy, ngunit habang ang kanilang pag-ibig ay cools , nagbabalik sila sa pagtingin, ang kanilang pag-ibig bilang pangangailangan. Tiyak na maging isang taong gumagawa ng pag-ibig at sa halip ay maging isang taong naghahanap ng pag-ibig. Nakalimutan nila na ang lihim ng loveis, na ito ay isang regalo, na maaari itong gawin upang lumago lamang sa pamamagitan ng pagbibigay nito.<br />

                            17. the true mark of maturity is when somebody hurt you try to understand their situation instead of trying to hurt them back. explain tagalog​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>People call themselves to be mature enough, but you can claim yourself to be mature enough only when you judge people by putting yourself into their shoes. Yes, at times, we are too quick to judge people around us, but that is not right.</p><p></p><p>You will see people yelling at you, or just blaming you for nothing, and you shout at them back. Well, did you even bother to take a pause and think what made them do so all of a sudden?</p><p></p><p>Maturity is when you stop and start to analyze the situation instead of reverting them with the same kind of response instantly. It is essential to give a try in analyzing people around you, particularly when you are aware of the usual behavioral traits of that same person.</p><p></p><p>Give yourself a thought if that day has been a bad day for him or her, maybe! You should be mature enough to understand the situation from that person’s perspective and try solving the puzzle, and you will start fetching the answers all by yourself.</p><p></p><p>I know, you might be hurt, but if you are mature enough, you will not hurt that person in return. Instead of reciprocating that individual with the same behavior, you would rather try to analyze the situation and try to think it from their perspective.</p><p></p><p>It is essential to understand that life happens, and you will definitely not want to give the same behavior to the person who has done wrong with you. When others do wrong with you, it doesn’t mean that you will also do wrong with them.</p><p></p><p>Instead of hurting the other person, you should stay calm and try to track the circumstances that he or she might have been going through, and that’s what is termed as ‘maturity’ in the true sense.</p><p></p><p>You should be composed enough to handle the situation in your own unique with a lot of love and compassion.</p><p></p><p>Tinatawag ng mga tao ang kanilang sarili bilang sapat na gulang, ngunit maaari mong sabihin na sapat na ang iyong sarili kapag hinuhusgahan mo ang mga tao sa pamamagitan ng paglalagay ng iyong sarili sa kanilang mga posisyon. Oo, kung minsan, napakabilis nating manghusga ng mga tao sa ating paligid, ngunit hindi iyon tama.</p><p></p><p>Makakakita ka ng mga taong sumisigaw sa iyo, o sinisisi ka lang sa wala, at sinisigawan mo sila pabalik. Buweno, nag-abala ka pa bang huminto at isipin kung ano ang naging dahilan upang gawin nila ito ng biglaan?</p><p></p><p>Ang maturity ay kapag huminto ka at nagsimulang suriin ang sitwasyon sa halip na ibalik ang mga ito sa parehong uri ng tugon kaagad. Mahalagang subukan ang pagsusuri sa mga tao sa paligid mo, lalo na kapag alam mo ang mga karaniwang ugali ng taong iyon.</p><p></p><p>Isipin ang iyong sarili kung ang araw na iyon ay naging isang masamang araw para sa kanya, marahil! Dapat ay nasa hustong gulang ka upang maunawaan ang sitwasyon mula sa pananaw ng taong iyon at subukang lutasin ang puzzle, at sisimulan mong kunin ang mga sagot nang mag-isa.</p><p></p><p>Alam ko, baka masaktan ka, pero kung mature ka na, hindi mo sasaktan ang taong iyon bilang kapalit. Sa halip na gantihan ang indibidwal na iyon na may parehong pag-uugali, mas gugustuhin mong subukang pag-aralan ang sitwasyon at subukang isipin ito mula sa kanilang pananaw.</p><p></p><p>Mahalagang maunawaan na nangyayari ang buhay, at tiyak na hindi mo nais na magbigay ng parehong pag-uugali sa taong gumawa ng mali sa iyo. Kapag nagkamali ang iba sa iyo, hindi ibig sabihin na gagawa ka rin ng mali sa kanila.</p><p></p><p>Sa halip na saktan ang ibang tao, dapat kang manatiling kalmado at subukang subaybayan ang mga pangyayari na maaaring pinagdadaanan niya, at iyon ang tinatawag na 'maturity' sa totoong kahulugan.</p><p></p><p>Ikaw ay dapat na binubuo ng sapat na upang mahawakan ang sitwasyon sa iyong sariling natatanging may maraming pagmamahal at pakikiramay.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            30. They had moved here to the island of Mindoro about a year ago because Julio had been unable to find any land of his own to farm. As it was, he thought himself lucky when Ka Ponso agreed to take him on as a tenant. “Dear Compadre,” he started writing. A while before, his wife had given birth to a baby. Ka Ponso had happened to be in the neighborhood and offered to be the baby’s godfather. After that they had begun to call each other compadre. Julio was writing in Tagalog, bending earnestly over a piece of paper torn out of his son’s school notebook. It was many months since he had had a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the municipal office in Mansalay to file a homestead application. Then he had used a pen and, to his surprise, he had been able to fill in the blank form neatly. Nothing had come of the application, although Ka Ponso had assured him he had looked into the matter and talked with the officials concerned. Now, using a pencil instead of a pen, Julio was sure he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso. Answer the following questions based on the text. 1. Who had moved to the island of Mindoro? 2. Why did they move to the island? 3. How did Ka Ponso help him? 4. How are Ka Ponso and Julio related to each other? 5. What was it that Julio was happy about? 6. What positive characteristics did Julio show in the story? Did you admire him for that? Why, explain your answer.</h2><br />
