It can be expressed as: Distance= initial position + final position (d= di + di The length in which the bicycle rider (in the illustration above) covers from initial position (from rest) to his final destination referred to the distance. Meanwhile, displacement is the net change in position of an object. It is expressed as: Ad = d-do Displacement di = final position Greek letter delta, A, means change in do = initial position If the final position is the same as the initial position, the Ad=0; meaning it cancelled each other out when added together. Take for example: A man driving a tricycle from home headed to a gasoline station to load gas which is 5 km away. After loading the gas, it heads back home covering a total distance of 10 km since the tricycle ended up in the same starting point. Hence; Ad = d-doo = Ad=5 km from gasoline station to original position-5 km from original position to gasoline station Explain when the displacement of an object is equal to zero? Answer:​</p>

They begin Their lives in water, then move on to land where they make their homes. The frog is an amphibian. The female frog lays hundreds of eggs in fresh shallow water. The eggs are covered and protected by a gelatin-like coating. In a few days, the eggs hatch into larvae. The larvae breathe by means of gills like the fish. They live on the yolk of the egg from which they come from. Soon the larvae become tadpoles. The tadpole breathes through gills and lives in the water, and its long tail gives it a fish-like appearance. As the tadpole grows, the tail gradually disappears, and its hind legs appear. The gills are replaced by lungs, and short front legs take shape.With two pairs of legs and with lungs finally developed, the tadpole becomes an adult frog. It moves into land. The frog may live near the water but, will not and cannot make its home in the water.Questions: 6.why is frog an amphibian? Define the habitat of frog.7-10. what is the life cycle of frog?​</a>

Why They Turn to the Sea As job opportunities are decreasing on land, more young people are luming to the sea for a living. Some of them choose to work on ships. However, many young people would rather work on the sea than on land. In my opinion, there are several reasons that account for increasing interest in pursuing maritime professions. First, our country is made up of many lands. We are surrounded by water. It is not surprising that many people have grown to love the sea, they decide to work on it Second, some school dropouts in the country as well as those young people who have just finished their education in school are looking for jobs at the same time. Many fail to get work in offices or factories, so these young people turn to the sea as last resort. Third, some young people face problems at home. They want to get as far away from these problems as possible. The sea becomes a popular means of escape. Finally, young people are naturally advantageous. They love to explore new places. They enjoy excitement that comes with this. By working on ships, they can travel far and wide. Thus, many young people are attracted to the maritime profession.

                                            TASK #2 Pricing Strategies In this activity, your task is to set the price for a new home-delivered spring water (the large bulk bottles) company. To complicate matters, you have a few different viewpoints on the best pricing approach. What would you decide? ACTIVITY/TASK Spring water is a product that has become popular over the past 10-15 years or so. During the growth phase of the market, a number of businesses were set up to deliver 'bulk' (large bottle) spring water directly to offices, businesses, and homes. consumer's homes. This case looks at a home-delivered spring water firm that used door-to-door sales (canvassing) as their main promotional method. This approach was adopted to ensure that their customers were all located in close geographical proximity (in order to reduce delivery time). One of the firm's three owners believes that by using this promotional method the firm can set its price at a premium level, as consumers are not in a position to compare prices. He said: &gt; "These consumers are not in a supermarket and cannot compare prices. We turn up at their door unexpectedly and say we can deliver spring water in bulk to your home at a good price, which compared to their normal small bottle purchase that sounds like a great deal. Therefore, I think we should charge P7.50 for our bottles." However, the second owner did not want to be so aggressive on price. According to her: &gt; "I think that we should under-cut the market. Currently, the cheapest bottle on the market is P5, so let's go out there with at a P4 price. At that price we will win a lot of customers. Then, later on, we can price the increase every six months or so - first to P5, then to P6, and finally to P7. That means that we'll have lots of customers all paying P7 per bottle. The third owner wasn't sure about either of the first two approaches. His view was: &gt; "I think that we should be a price follower. We know that the market is willing to pay between P5 and P6.50 per bottle. Personally, I think it would be risky to price outside that range. We don't know whether the market will pay more, and we also don't know if our customers will be happy with a series of price increases." QUESTIONS 1. Given the pricing views of the three owners, what price would you set? Why? 2. Would it be feasible to start by under-cutting the market to grow market share and then increase prices to the captive customer base? Why/why not? 3. Other than competitor pricing, what other factors should the management team take into account when setting their prices?​</a>

They begin their lives inthe water, then move on to land where they make their homes.The frog is an amphibian. The female frog lays hundreds of eggs in fresh shallow water. Theeggs are covered and protected by a gelatin-like coating. In a few days, the eggs hatch intolarvae. The larvae breathe by means of gills like the fish. They live on the yolk of the eggfrom which they come from. Soon the larvae become tadpoles.The tadpole breathes through gills and lives in the water, and its long tail gives it a fish-likeappearance. As the tadpole grows, the tail gradually disappears, and its hind legs appear.The gills are replaced by lungs, and short front legs take shape.With two pairs of legs and with lungs finally developed, the tadpole becomes an adult frog. Itmoves into land. The frog may live near the water but, will not and cannot make its home inthe water.. Complete the outline below by supplying correct information from the text read.. A.

Mary has been studying for weeks for the final exam in calculus. The
test is Monday. On Friday afternoon her boyfriend, Paul, tells her that
he has tickets for the Saturday and Sunday performances of the
annual Shakespeare Festival. Mary loves Shakespeare and would
really like to spend time with Paul but feels guilty and anxious about it
because she must continue to study for the exam. She eventually
realizes that she can tell Paul that she must study on Saturday, but
would love to go with him on Sunday.

Situation 2
Tom has just gotten his driver’s license. His parents allow him to drive
to and from school, but nowhere else before or after. His friends want
him to drive them to the video arcade on the way home, which is about
2 miles out of his way. Tom feels nervous at first, and then starts
thinking how mean his friends’ suggestion is and that he should find
new friends who won’t ask him to break rules.

Second, some school dropouts in the country as well as those young people who have just finished their education in school are tooking for jobs at the same time. Many fail to get work in offices or factories, so these young people turn to the sea as last resort. Third, some young people face problems at home. They want to get as far away from these problems as possible. The sea becomes a popular means of escape. Finally, young people are naturally advantageous. They love to explore new places. They enjoy excitement that comes with this. By working on ships, they can travel far and wide. Thus, many young people are attracted to the maritime profession.​</a>

Essential Matters by Li Li
Let me count a few things that I can’t do without. In the past there were letters, so envelopes and post offices were essential. Then, there must be doves, a cool breeze, reveries, and a backdrop of dusk on my way to the post office. A place to say farewell was essential when it’s time to leave home; there was a ticket in my hand, him at the windy train station, tears in our eyes, and the satisfaction running down my body as I turned around. Reaching middle-age, children nearby and healthy parents are essential, so are the lovely words on the pages I turn, and the scents of the fruits that he brought to the room. Finally, the peach flowers that bloom overnight, if you smell the sweet-scented ghosts under the trees, please know they are my family who left this world too early.</a>

                                            Let’s Apply- Choose the letter of the correct answer 1. Every May 14 Parañaque's annual fiesta is highlighted by its very unique street pageant called the Sunduan. The term "sunduan" is derived from the word sundo which literally means "to fetch" and relates to an old courtship custom of waiting on one’s lady love, accompanying her to the town plaza, and bringing her home. Sunduan is another celebration unique to Parañaque. It conveys the message that Paraqueños are romantics; that their womenfolk are regarded with love and respect; and that Chivalry is alive in Parañaque. 1.The summary of the passage is: * A. Sunduan means “to fetch” B. Sunduan is usually organized by the parish. C. The term “sunduan is derived from the word sundo D. Parañaque’s annual fiesta is highlighted by its very unique pageant called the "Sunduan' 2. Cats are affectionate, cuddly, and independent. Unlike dogs, cats can stay on their own if you go away overnight. They do not need to be walked, and can monitor their own food so they don’t overeat. Also, cats do not bark, so your neighbors won’t have any noise to complain about. If someone wants to have a pet, a cat is a great choice! 2. The summary of the passage is : * A. Cats are independent. B. Cats are great pets. C. Dogs are a lot of work D. Pets are hard work 3. In the Philippines, a fish port, such as this one located in Parañaque City, is popularly called, “Bulungan,” which means “whispered bidding”. This is the system of market retailers haggling for wholesale purchases of fresh seafood straight from the fishermen’s boats. The place is alive during the very early hours of the morning. 3. The summary of the passage is : * A. Parañaque City is called “Bulungan.” B. There are market retailers in Parañaque. C. The fish port is alive during the very early hours of the morning. D. A fish port in Parañaque is popularly called “Bulungan” which means “whispered bidding.” 4. Palanyag, the old name for the city of Parañaque, generally means "my beloved", among other definitions, for as far as its residents are concerned, this best describes their affection for their hometown. Another version came from the combination of the terms "palayan" and "palalayag", the former meaning rice fields of which the city once abounded in and the latter pertaining to the sailing and fishing occupation of many of its residents. This was also a sign of cooperation and goodwill between the two major working sectors of the town, the farmers and the fishermen. It was however a drunken guest, during a certain affair which decided on the final name, who said "Mabuhay ang Palanyag at ang mga taga-Palanyag! (Long live Palanyag and the people of Palanyag!)" So the name stuck from that day on 4. The summary of the passage is : * A. Palanyag was given as a final name by a drunken guest. B.

                                            What is the main idea of this text
Recent research on wealth and household finances seeks to blend neoclassical models with an understanding of real-world imperfections to answer questions about why some people save and others do not. This paper focuses on Baby Boomers standing on the verge of retirement, many of whom have saved little and will face financial insecurity in old age. The new 2004 wave of the Health and Retirement Study is invaluable for this first analysis of the financial situation of leading-edge Boomers, as it reports not only wealth levels but also information about respondents' planning behaviors and economic literacy. We show that the distribution of net worth among Early Baby Boomers is quite skewed, those in the 75th percentile had over 10 times the net worth ($400K) of households in the bottom 25th percentile ($37K). There is substantial heterogeneity in wealth within this cohort: the median high-school dropout had less than $23K in total net worth, while the median college graduate had over 10 times as much. Many Black and Hispanic Boomer households hold miniscule levels of wealth. Further, many in this cohort have accumulated little wealth outside their homes: at the mean, one third of the early Boomers' wealth is held in the form of home equity, and at the median the fraction is close to half. Since many members of this EBB cohort are reaching retirement with a substantial portion of their wealth in housing, they are particularly vulnerable to housing value shocks. By contrast, holders of stocks, IRAs, and business equity are concentrated in the top quartiles, Finally, we show that planning and economic literacy are important predictors of savings and investment success.</a>

                            1. 1. Distance vs. displacement The distance is the length of path between the initial and final position of the object. It can be expressed as: Distance= initial position + final position (d= di + di The length in which the bicycle rider (in the illustration above) covers from initial position (from rest) to his final destination referred to the distance. Meanwhile, displacement is the net change in position of an object. It is expressed as: Ad = d-do Displacement di = final position Greek letter delta, A, means change in do = initial position If the final position is the same as the initial position, the Ad=0; meaning it cancelled each other out when added together. Take for example: A man driving a tricycle from home headed to a gasoline station to load gas which is 5 km away. After loading the gas, it heads back home covering a total distance of 10 km since the tricycle ended up in the same starting point. Hence; Ad = d-doo = Ad=5 km from gasoline station to original position-5 km from original position to gasoline station Explain when the displacement of an object is equal to zero? Answer:​</h2><br />

They begin Their lives in water, then move on to land where they make their homes. The frog is an amphibian. The female frog lays hundreds of eggs in fresh shallow water. The eggs are covered and protected by a gelatin-like coating. In a few days, the eggs hatch into larvae. The larvae breathe by means of gills like the fish. They live on the yolk of the egg from which they come from. Soon the larvae become tadpoles. The tadpole breathes through gills and lives in the water, and its long tail gives it a fish-like appearance. As the tadpole grows, the tail gradually disappears, and its hind legs appear. The gills are replaced by lungs, and short front legs take shape.With two pairs of legs and with lungs finally developed, the tadpole becomes an adult frog. It moves into land. The frog may live near the water but, will not and cannot make its home in the water.Questions: 6.why is frog an amphibian?

                            10. D. Read the paragraph and fill in the table about it. Why They Turn to the Sea As job opportunities are decreasing on land, more young people are luming to the sea for a living. Some of them choose to work on ships. However, many young people would rather work on the sea than on land. In my opinion, there are several reasons that account for increasing interest in pursuing maritime professions. First, our country is made up of many lands. We are surrounded by water. It is not surprising that many people have grown to love the sea, they decide to work on it Second, some school dropouts in the country as well as those young people who have just finished their education in school are looking for jobs at the same time. Many fail to get work in offices or factories, so these young people turn to the sea as last resort. Third, some young people face problems at home. They want to get as far away from these problems as possible. The sea becomes a popular means of escape. Finally, young people are naturally advantageous. They love to explore new places. They enjoy excitement that comes with this. By working on ships, they can travel far and wide. Thus, many young people are attracted to the maritime profession.

                            14. TASK #2 Pricing Strategies In this activity, your task is to set the price for a new home-delivered spring water (the large bulk bottles) company. To complicate matters, you have a few different viewpoints on the best pricing approach. What would you decide? ACTIVITY/TASK Spring water is a product that has become popular over the past 10-15 years or so. During the growth phase of the market, a number of businesses were set up to deliver 'bulk' (large bottle) spring water directly to offices, businesses, and homes. consumer's homes. This case looks at a home-delivered spring water firm that used door-to-door sales (canvassing) as their main promotional method. This approach was adopted to ensure that their customers were all located in close geographical proximity (in order to reduce delivery time). One of the firm's three owners believes that by using this promotional method the firm can set its price at a premium level, as consumers are not in a position to compare prices. He said: &gt; "These consumers are not in a supermarket and cannot compare prices. We turn up at their door unexpectedly and say we can deliver spring water in bulk to your home at a good price, which compared to their normal small bottle purchase that sounds like a great deal. Therefore, I think we should charge P7.50 for our bottles." However, the second owner did not want to be so aggressive on price. According to her: &gt; "I think that we should under-cut the market. Currently, the cheapest bottle on the market is P5, so let's go out there with at a P4 price. At that price we will win a lot of customers. Then, later on, we can price the increase every six months or so - first to P5, then to P6, and finally to P7. That means that we'll have lots of customers all paying P7 per bottle. The third owner wasn't sure about either of the first two approaches. His view was: &gt; "I think that we should be a price follower. We know that the market is willing to pay between P5 and P6.50 per bottle. Personally, I think it would be risky to price outside that range. We don't know whether the market will pay more, and we also don't know if our customers will be happy with a series of price increases." QUESTIONS 1. Given the pricing views of the three owners, what price would you set? Why? 2. Would it be feasible to start by under-cutting the market to grow market share and then increase prices to the captive customer base? Why/why not? 3. Other than competitor pricing, what other factors should the management team take into account when setting their prices?​</h2><br />

                            15. I. A Read the paragraph below with automaticity. The Life Cycle of FrogsAmphibians are animals that spend their lives in two distinct places. They begin their lives inthe water, then move on to land where they make their homes.The frog is an amphibian. The female frog lays hundreds of eggs in fresh shallow water. Theeggs are covered and protected by a gelatin-like coating. In a few days, the eggs hatch intolarvae. The larvae breathe by means of gills like the fish. They live on the yolk of the eggfrom which they come from. Soon the larvae become tadpoles.The tadpole breathes through gills and lives in the water, and its long tail gives it a fish-likeappearance. As the tadpole grows, the tail gradually disappears, and its hind legs appear.The gills are replaced by lungs, and short front legs take shape.With two pairs of legs and with lungs finally developed, the tadpole becomes an adult frog. Itmoves into land. The frog may live near the water but, will not and cannot make its home inthe water.. Complete the outline below by supplying correct information from the text read.. A.

                            18. Read the following situational descriptions and identify which of Freud’s personality
components are at work here.
Situation 1
Mary has been studying for weeks for the final exam in calculus. The
test is Monday. On Friday afternoon her boyfriend, Paul, tells her that
he has tickets for the Saturday and Sunday performances of the
annual Shakespeare Festival. Mary loves Shakespeare and would
really like to spend time with Paul but feels guilty and anxious about it
because she must continue to study for the exam. She eventually
realizes that she can tell Paul that she must study on Saturday, but
would love to go with him on Sunday.
_______________________________________________________
Situation 2
Tom has just gotten his driver’s license. His parents allow him to drive
to and from school, but nowhere else before or after. His friends want
him to drive them to the video arcade on the way home, which is about
2 miles out of his way. Tom feels nervous at first, and then starts
thinking how mean his friends’ suggestion is and that he should find
new friends who won’t ask him to break rules.
__________________________________</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Situation 1: Mary's behavior can be explained by the conflict between the id, ego, and superego components of Freud's personality theory. The id is the primitive, instinctual part of the personality that seeks immediate gratification of desires, without regard for consequences or morality. The ego is the rational, logical part of the personality that mediates between the id and the external world, seeking to satisfy desires in a socially acceptable way. The superego is the moralistic part of the personality that represents internalized values and ideals, seeking to inhibit or control the impulses of the id. Mary's desire to go to the Shakespeare Festival with her boyfriend is an expression of her id, while her guilt and anxiety about neglecting her studies is an expression of her superego. Her decision to compromise and go to the festival on Sunday is an expression of her ego, which seeks to balance the demands of the id and the superego.</p><p></p><p>Situation 2: Tom's behavior can also be explained by the conflict between the id, ego, and superego components of Freud's personality theory. In this case, Tom's desire to please his friends and go to the video arcade is an expression of his id, while his fear of breaking rules and disappointing his parents is an expression of his superego. His decision to refuse his friends' request and consider finding new friends who won't ask him to break rules is an expression of his ego, which seeks to balance the demands of the id and the superego in a socially acceptable way.</p><br />

Essential Matters by Li Li
Let me count a few things that I can’t do without. In the past there were letters, so envelopes and post offices were essential. Then, there must be doves, a cool breeze, reveries, and a backdrop of dusk on my way to the post office. A place to say farewell was essential when it’s time to leave home; there was a ticket in my hand, him at the windy train station, tears in our eyes, and the satisfaction running down my body as I turned around. Reaching middle-age, children nearby and healthy parents are essential, so are the lovely words on the pages I turn, and the scents of the fruits that he brought to the room. Finally, the peach flowers that bloom overnight, if you smell the sweet-scented ghosts under the trees, please know they are my family who left this world too early.</h2><br />

                            28. Let’s Apply- Choose the letter of the correct answer 1. Every May 14 Parañaque's annual fiesta is highlighted by its very unique street pageant called the Sunduan. The term "sunduan" is derived from the word sundo which literally means "to fetch" and relates to an old courtship custom of waiting on one’s lady love, accompanying her to the town plaza, and bringing her home. Sunduan is another celebration unique to Parañaque. It conveys the message that Paraqueños are romantics; that their womenfolk are regarded with love and respect; and that Chivalry is alive in Parañaque. 1.The summary of the passage is: * A. Sunduan means “to fetch” B. Sunduan is usually organized by the parish. C. The term “sunduan is derived from the word sundo D. Parañaque’s annual fiesta is highlighted by its very unique pageant called the "Sunduan' 2. Cats are affectionate, cuddly, and independent. Unlike dogs, cats can stay on their own if you go away overnight. They do not need to be walked, and can monitor their own food so they don’t overeat. Also, cats do not bark, so your neighbors won’t have any noise to complain about. If someone wants to have a pet, a cat is a great choice! 2. The summary of the passage is : * A. Cats are independent. B. Cats are great pets. C. Dogs are a lot of work D. Pets are hard work 3. In the Philippines, a fish port, such as this one located in Parañaque City, is popularly called, “Bulungan,” which means “whispered bidding”. This is the system of market retailers haggling for wholesale purchases of fresh seafood straight from the fishermen’s boats. The place is alive during the very early hours of the morning. 3. The summary of the passage is : * A. Parañaque City is called “Bulungan.” B. There are market retailers in Parañaque. C. The fish port is alive during the very early hours of the morning. D. A fish port in Parañaque is popularly called “Bulungan” which means “whispered bidding.” 4. Palanyag, the old name for the city of Parañaque, generally means "my beloved", among other definitions, for as far as its residents are concerned, this best describes their affection for their hometown. Another version came from the combination of the terms "palayan" and "palalayag", the former meaning rice fields of which the city once abounded in and the latter pertaining to the sailing and fishing occupation of many of its residents. This was also a sign of cooperation and goodwill between the two major working sectors of the town, the farmers and the fishermen. It was however a drunken guest, during a certain affair which decided on the final name, who said "Mabuhay ang Palanyag at ang mga taga-Palanyag! (Long live Palanyag and the people of Palanyag!)" So the name stuck from that day on 4. The summary of the passage is : * A. Palanyag was given as a final name by a drunken guest. B. Palanyag best described the residents’ affection for their hometown. C. Palanyag was an old name of Parañaque which means “my beloved.” D. Palanyag is a cooperation and goodwill between the farmers and fishermen 5. When the Redemptorists came to Baclaran in 1932, Baclaran was a small desolate village of grassland near the sea. Little did they imagine that someday, the small wooden chapel would transform into the biggest shrine in the world dedicated to Our Mother of Perpetual Help. Little did they imagine that someday, Baclaran would transform into a booming town and an international pilgrim center The phenomenon exploded after the Redemptorists began the novena in 1948. Only 70 people attended the first novena. After a week, the number of devotees doubled. After several weeks, it came to a thousand. After a few months, it came to several thousands. The rest is history! 5. The summary of the passage is : * A. Baclaran is found in Parañaque. B. Baclaran was transformed into a booming town and international pilgrim center C. Only 70 people attended the first novena in Baclaran.Option 3 D. Baclaran was a small desolate village of grassland near the sea.grade 6​</h2><br />

                            29. What is the main idea of this text
Recent research on wealth and household finances seeks to blend neoclassical models with an understanding of real-world imperfections to answer questions about why some people save and others do not. This paper focuses on Baby Boomers standing on the verge of retirement, many of whom have saved little and will face financial insecurity in old age. The new 2004 wave of the Health and Retirement Study is invaluable for this first analysis of the financial situation of leading-edge Boomers, as it reports not only wealth levels but also information about respondents' planning behaviors and economic literacy. We show that the distribution of net worth among Early Baby Boomers is quite skewed, those in the 75th percentile had over 10 times the net worth ($400K) of households in the bottom 25th percentile ($37K). There is substantial heterogeneity in wealth within this cohort: the median high-school dropout had less than $23K in total net worth, while the median college graduate had over 10 times as much. Many Black and Hispanic Boomer households hold miniscule levels of wealth. Further, many in this cohort have accumulated little wealth outside their homes: at the mean, one third of the early Boomers' wealth is held in the form of home equity, and at the median the fraction is close to half. Since many members of this EBB cohort are reaching retirement with a substantial portion of their wealth in housing, they are particularly vulnerable to housing value shocks. By contrast, holders of stocks, IRAs, and business equity are concentrated in the top quartiles, Finally, we show that planning and economic literacy are important predictors of savings and investment success.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:<br />Main idea: Recent research wealth and household finances seeks to blend neoclassical models with an understanding of real-world imperfections to answer questions about why some people save and others do not own words: New property and household finance work attempts to combine neoclassical structures include a grasp of the imperfections of the modern world responding to concerns regarding why certain citizens save us and not some.
