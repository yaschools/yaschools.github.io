                                            Learning Task 3: Case Study
In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other
people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be
people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or another ethnicity. If you know someone
who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects. Since you are
not allowed to go out at present because of the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, look for someone who is
near to your place or whom you have contact with through social media.
Be guided with the following questions as you write your case study:
1. Describe the group of people that you chose. Who are they? What do they do? Where did they
come from? What do you know about them?
2. Discuss their way of life in terms of: a. Social organizations b. Language c. Religion d. Arts and
literature e. Economic systems f. Values, beliefs and traditions
3. Summarize what you have learned using the 3-2-1 chart below:
3 Things I learned from them
2 Things I found interesting
1 Thing I realize</a>

                                            pls translate to Tagalog/Filipino.It's great that the economy is growing and rebounding back from the hit it took from the COVID-19 pandemic. It's not there yet, but I'm optimistic about the situation.The government's plan to keep up the rise and recover by acceleration of the vaccineprogram is one I'm certainly looking forward to. If this pace continues, we're certainly recover.Further on, oil prices going to be still high or not is certainly another thing to watch out for, which the chief of the Natural Economic and Development authority said the country will be doing. They're saying they have it if it does go up, as I have no idea what they're talking about I'm going to trust them. Moving forward, Both industry and service sectors growing is positive, but agriculture growth being impeded and even pushed back by typhoons and the African swine fever is a shame. The rise in gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily driven by household consumption accounting for 5.2 percentage of overall GDP growth is great, I guess I'll have to buy more or something to help the economy.My reaction really isn't much of a reaction, but I certainly hope I'll understand most of these terms by the end of the school year.​</a>

                                            inequality in one variable. History of Carmona In the late 16th century, a Spanish colonial resettlement program was implemented across wide areas of what came to be known as the province of (EXAMPLE) CAVITE. The program was designed to integrate the Filipinos into the religious and political institutions of the Spaniards. (1)__________ was first established as a mission town in 1595. Together with the other mission towns in the province, it became one of the centers of religious and economic activities in the first centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Carmona used to be a barrio of the Mission Town of Silang. It was locally known as "(2)_____________ "", a tagalog word for plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. At that time, this barrio was just a small farming community with a very small population. As its population rapidly increased, religious and political separation from the town of Silang was later sought from Spain. Eventually, it became an independent municipality on February 20, 1857 by virtue of the Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de (5)__________ The name (3_______) was adopted as a sign of gratitude to the Spanish officials who influenced the Central Government at the time of separation of the barrio. With boundaries properly delineated and a church established, it started its own religious and political administration. The people of Carmona have actively participated in the revolution against the Spaniards. It also witnessed the Filipinos' resistance against the Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation, some of Carmona's prominent houses were used as Japanese headquarters while the hills became the stronghold of Filipino revolutionaries After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions or land conflicts.​</a>

                            4. Learning Task 3: Case Study
In this activity, you will be asked to conduct a simple case study examining the culture of other
people that is somehow different from yours. If you are an Ilocano, the subject of your study could be
people who identify themselves as Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, or another ethnicity. If you know someone
who belongs to an indigenous group of people, it is much better to have them as subjects. Since you are
not allowed to go out at present because of the threat of COVID-19 pandemic, look for someone who is
near to your place or whom you have contact with through social media.
Be guided with the following questions as you write your case study:
1. Describe the group of people that you chose. Who are they? What do they do? Where did they
come from? What do you know about them?
2. Discuss their way of life in terms of: a. Social organizations b. Language c. Religion d. Arts and
literature e. Economic systems f. Values, beliefs and traditions
3. Summarize what you have learned using the 3-2-1 chart below:

                            5. pls translate to Tagalog/Filipino.It's great that the economy is growing and rebounding back from the hit it took from the COVID-19 pandemic. It's not there yet, but I'm optimistic about the situation.The government's plan to keep up the rise and recover by acceleration of the vaccineprogram is one I'm certainly looking forward to. If this pace continues, we're certainly recover.Further on, oil prices going to be still high or not is certainly another thing to watch out for, which the chief of the Natural Economic and Development authority said the country will be doing. They're saying they have it if it does go up, as I have no idea what they're talking about I'm going to trust them. Moving forward, Both industry and service sectors growing is positive, but agriculture growth being impeded and even pushed back by typhoons and the African swine fever is a shame. The rise in gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily driven by household consumption accounting for 5.2 percentage of overall GDP growth is great, I guess I'll have to buy more or something to help the economy.My reaction really isn't much of a reaction, but I certainly hope I'll understand most of these terms by the end of the school year.​</h2><br />
