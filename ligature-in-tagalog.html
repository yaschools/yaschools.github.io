1. Field: Medicine
From the Autopsy Surgeon's Report
Death occurred from the effects of asphyxia, cerebral anemia, and shock. The victim's hair
was used for the constriction ligature. Local marks of the ligature were readily discernible: there were some
abrasion and a slight ecchymosis in the skin. But I found no obvious lesion in the blood vessels of the
neck. Cyanosis of the head was very slight and there were no pronounced hemorrhages in the galea of the
scalp. I should judge that very great compression was effected almost immediately, with compression of
the arteries as well as of the vein, and that the superior laryngeal nerve was traumatized in the effect of
throwing the victim into profound shock... The lungs revealed cyanosis, congestion, over aeration, and sub
pleural petechial haemorrhage.

                            19. why do people read ligature?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ligature can be distinguished from hanging by the strangling force of something other than the person’s full body weight. This type of strangulation cuts off blood flow to the brain and can be done in many ways besides vertical hanging. In most cases, this results in permanent brain damage, and sometimes death.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The term “Ligature” may not be familiar to some healthcare professionals. Ligature is not always a patient trying to harm themselves through the method of hanging. Ligature is usually performed by tying something around the neck, and applying pressure from a “tie off” point. In the past, this was often a showerhead, which has now been addressed by most facilities.</p><br />

1. Field: Medicine
From the Autopsy Surgeon's Report
Death occurred from the effects of asphyxia, cerebral anemia, and shock. The victim's hair
was used for the constriction ligature. Local marks of the ligature were readily discernible: there were some
abrasion and a slight ecchymosis in the skin. But I found no obvious lesion in the blood vessels of the
neck. Cyanosis of the head was very slight and there were no pronounced hemorrhages in the galea of the
scalp. I should judge that very great compression was effected almost immediately, with compression of
the arteries as well as of the vein, and that the superior laryngeal nerve was traumatized in the effect of
throwing the victim into profound shock... The lungs revealed cyanosis, congestion, over aeration, and sub
pleural petechial haemorrhage.
