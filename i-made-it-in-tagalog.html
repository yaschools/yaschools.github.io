During his first days in school, Jose was very quiet in class. Whis their classmates were playing and talking during recess and lunch break, Jose was seated in one comer, eating his snack or his lunch. One lunch break, Andrew takes his friends about Jose. He told them, I noticed that our new classmate, Jose, has made any friend in class yet." Can we invite him to join in the group? What do you thin "I do not think he knows how to speak Tagalog. He may not understand us in invite him to join our group." Paolo immediately replied. He may not enjoy the same thing that we enjoy as Manileños, Miguel, another classmate of Andrew, added. Wel, you are both right," Andrew said. But I think we should not ignore him just becaus he is different from us. I do not think it is right to judge him before we even try to ma friends with him. So, what are we waiting for? Let's go and invite him now to join us! lunch, Andrew eagerly asked. All together, the three of them approached Jose and greeted him, would you like to join us for lunch? Jose was so surprised that he was not able to reply at once. After a couple of seconds, he smiled and said, Oh, hi! Are you really inviting me for lunch? Jose timidly asked? " Yes, we are inviting you for lunch, "the three boys replied in unison. " Oh, yes, I would like to join!" Jose immediately replied. From then on Jose became happy as he was frequently invited by the three boys to join the group. They became friends, and they all played and ate together.1. Who was the transferee in grade four?2.

I did not like the work, the heat, or the tough boss, and for the first couple of weeks, my attitude reflected my unhappiness. The job wouldn’t change, I realized, but my way of thinking could. I decided to work as if the Lord was my boss, and that choice made all the difference. Explanation in tagalog</a>

The New Boy in ClassOne day, a boy named Jose who came from the province of Northern Luzon transferred to a grade 4 class. His whole family transferred to Manila because of the work of his dad. During his first days in school, Jose was very quiet in class. Whis their classmates were playing and talking during recess and lunch break, Jose was seated in one comer, eating his snack or his lunch. One lunch break, Andrew takes his friends about Jose. He told them, I noticed that our new classmate, Jose, has made any friend in class yet." Can we invite him to join in the group? What do you thin "I do not think he knows how to speak Tagalog. He may not understand us in invite him to join our group." Paolo immediately replied. He may not enjoy the same thing that we enjoy as Manileños, Miguel, another classmate of Andrew, added. Wel, you are both right," Andrew said. But I think we should not ignore him just becaus he is different from us. I do not think it is right to judge him before we even try to ma friends with him. So, what are we waiting for? Let's go and invite him now to join us! lunch, Andrew eagerly asked. All together, the three of them approached Jose and greeted him, would you like to join us for lunch? Jose was so surprised that he was not able to reply at once. After a couple of seconds, he smiled and said, Oh, hi! Are you really inviting me for lunch? Jose timidly asked?
