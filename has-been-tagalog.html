Baguio City has been Northern Luzon's university hub for
many decades. Unbeknownst to most, it is also a cultural
melting pot due to numerous influences from different
cultures, not just from people of Cordilleran descent, but
also from people from Pangasinan and the Ilocos region.
The most common languages spoken in the city are Ilokano.
Kankana-ey, and Ifugao, as well as Pangasinense and
Tagalog. English and Filipino are also understood by most
inhabitants of the city.</a>

As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</a>

I believe it is possible if the government themselves make the first move because with enough power and charisma a single person
can move an opinion of a single country, this has been proven true through events like the French and Russian revolution.
As long as the people are given a reason to look up to and respect this decision then achieving equality is far from impossible.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>English: This theory suggests that a significant amount of juvenile delinquency is caused by the mistreatment of children by adults, especially within the family context.

The theory proposes that delinquency may be a response to injustice.</p><p></p><p>Tagalog: Ayon sa teoryang ito, malaki ang naidudulot ng pang-aabuso ng mga matatanda sa mga bata, lalo na sa loob ng pamilya, sa pagkakaroon ng mga kabataang delinkwente.

                            26. What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</h2><br />

                        Answer: ✏<p></p><p><strong>"Love Letter for Mother Earth"</strong></p><p></p><p>We are all aware that Earth is the only planet on which life exists.</p><p>Since of now, it is apparent that this planet has been a gift to us humans and other living things, as it provides us with all of the resources we require. Everything we need is provided by Earth, from air to water to food, which is why we call it Mother Earth. We would not have existed if not for the beauty of the environment and the abundance of resources available on the planet. But, what have we done to our mother earth? We have exploited the earth for our own ends, and now the planet we call our mother faces the threat of extinction of life on its soil due to our bad behavior. Pollution levels are at an all-time high, and resources are rapidly depleting. To save our mother earth, we must take adequate precautions. Every day, we generate tons of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste and dispose of it irresponsibly. She is being suffocated by smoke and harmful gases emitted by our homes, vehicles, and industries. We are recklessly disposing of dirty sewage, drainage, and even chemicals, despite the fact that more than 7 billion humans, as well as all plants and animals on the planet, rely on water for survival. For agriculture and settlement, we destroy forests. We construct massive structures, roads, and factories that exceed her carrying capacity. The construction of nuclear reactors has a significant impact on the environment and human lives. Air pollution causes airborne diseases such as asthma in humans and animals, as well as disrupting the entire metabolism process in plants. In humans, noise pollution causes insomnia and heart disease. Deforestation causes natural disasters such as floods, soil erosion, and so on, as well as temperature rise and altered rainfall distribution, drought, loss of valuable biodiversity, decreased oxygen density, and so on. The world's most pressing issues at the moment are "Climate Change &amp; Greenhouse Effect." Thus, for the sake of our planet's sustainability, I promise to fulfill my responsibilities as a global citizen to Mother Nature in order to protect my living planet from deterioration and to leave a clean and green planet to future generations. Our individual efforts may appear insignificant, but if thousands of young people act together to protect nature, our efforts will one day be a significant step toward protecting our motherland Earth from destruction.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            29.  Cakes should be cut as needed to keep them from drying out. A piece of parchment paper, or plastic wrap should be placed on the inside of the cut after a slice of cake has been removed to prevent drying out.mag rereport ako, paki explain po kahit tagalog nlng po​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When a cake is cut, the exposed edges of the remaining cake are susceptible to drying out. This can result in a less appetizing texture and flavor, and also make the cake less enjoyable to eat. By cutting the cake as needed, we can reduce the amount of time the cake is exposed to air, and therefore reduce the risk of drying out.</p><p></p><p>In addition, placing a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap on the cut surface of the cake helps to prevent moisture from escaping. This creates a barrier between the cake and the air, helping to preserve the moisture and freshness of the cake.</p><p></p><p>Overall, cutting cakes as needed and using parchment paper or plastic wrap to cover the cut surface can help to ensure that the cake stays moist and delicious, and is enjoyed to the fullest extent.</p><p><strong>Explanation: Hope it helps :)</strong></p><p></p><br />
