                                            As the dismaying predicament seemed beyond solution, Rizal’s nimble brain conceived a cute solution. Appearing perfectly at ease, he turned to the waiter and said, “My dear fellow,” he spoke in French, “don’t you worry.” Pointing to Luna with a flourish of his hand, he said, “Monsieur is quite right. I am the host of this party and I will take care of everything. But first, let my guests complete their meal. We must have black coffee and the best brandy the house can offer. I want the coffee to be freshly brewed. Tell the chef to boil it slowly and nicely. I’ll give him a handsome tip – and to be sure, you will receive a bigger one. The waiter relieved at the turn of the situation had taken and heartened by the promise of the big tip, went to the restaurant’s kitchen to supervise personally the making of the coffee. The brown gentlemen spoke such excellent French, he surely must be a rich potentiate or Maharajah from the Far East. There was really nothing to fear about the bill, so he mused. Back at the table, the Filipinos were demanding an explanation. Rizal was silent, his brown eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement. “Now, you’re making it worse,” upbraided the hot-tempered Luna. “You know we all have no money and still you ordered coffee and brandy to say nothing of the big tips you promised the cook and the waiter. Why do you want to disgrace us all? Are you a fool?” “No,” was Rizal’s laconic answer. To the great amazement of Luna and the others, Rizal took out from his coat pocket a portable water color set, and serenely began to paint a 10-pound sterling note on the porcelain platter. Dexterously, with a few master strokes he finished an astounding replica of the note before the arrival of the steaming coffee and the brandy. “My good fellow,” Rizal told the smiling waiter. Pointing to the platter: “There’s the payment for all we have taken. You may keep the change.” The waiter’s eyes lit up. Bowing low in the best tradition of a French waiter acknowledging an unusually good tip, the waiter was full of effusive thanks. “Monsieur is most generous, Merci!” reaching for the platter he bowed out with many sonorous kiss of his fingertips. Calmly, Rizal started to sip his coffee and brandy while enjoying the amazement on the faces of his compatriots who all held their breaths while waiting for what inevitably would happen next.Comprehension Check: What do you suppose happened right after?

                                            Rizal’s Letter: To the Young Women of Malolos(excerpt)When I wrote Noli Me Tangere, I asked myself whether bravery was a common thing in the young women of our people. I brought back to my recollection and reviewed those I had known since my infancy, but there were only few who seem to come up to my ideal. There was, it is true, an abundance of girls with agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but there was in all an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so called “spiritual fathers” (as if the spirit or soul had any father other than God), due to excessive kindness, modesty, or perhaps ignorance. They seemed faded plants sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap.However, when the news of what happened at Malolos reached us, I saw my error, and great was my rejoicing. After all, who is to blame me? I did not know Malolos nor its young women, except one called Emila [Emilia Tiongson, whom Rizal met in 1887], and her I knew by name only.Now that you have responded to our first appeal in the interest of the welfare of the people; now that you have set an example to those who, like you, long to have their eyes opened and be delivered from servitude, new hopes are awakened in us and we now even dare to face adversity, because we have you for our allies and are confident of victory. No longer does the Filipina stand with her head bowed nor does she spend her time on her knees, because she is quickened by hope in the future; no longer will the mother contribute to keeping her daughter in darkness and bring her up in contempt and moral annihilation. And no longer will the science of all sciences consist in blind submission to any unjust order, or in extreme complacency, nor will a courteous smile be deemed the only weapon against insult or humble tears the ineffable panacea for all tribulations. You know that the will of God is different from that of the priest; that religiousness does not consist of long periods spent on your knees, nor in endless prayers, big rosarios, and grimy scapularies [religious garment showing devotion], but in a spotless conduct, firm intention, and upright judgment. You also know that prudence does not consist in blindly obeying any whim of the little tin god, but in obeying only that which is reasonable and just, because blind obedience is itself the cause and origin of those whims, and those guilty of it are really to be blamed. The official or friar can no longer assert that they alone are responsible for their unjust orders, because God gave each individual reason and a will of his or her own to distinguish the just from the unjust; all were born without shackles and free, and nobody has a right to subjugate the will and the spirit of another your thoughts. And, why should you submit to another your thoughts, seeing that thought is noble and free?THIS SUBJECT IS "21ST CENTURY LITERATURE"Question:Base on the first paragraph, how did jose rizal describe the filipino wowen?​</a>

                                            As the dismaying predicament seemed beyond solution, Rizal’s nimble brain conceived a cute solution. Appearing perfectly at ease, he turned to the waiter and said, “My dear fellow,” he spoke in French, “don’t you worry.” Pointing to Luna with a flourish of his hand, he said, “Monsieur is quite right. I am the host of this party and I will take care of everything. But first, let my guests complete their meal. We must have black coffee and the best brandy the house can offer. I want the coffee to be freshly brewed. Tell the chef to boil it slowly and nicely. I’ll give him a handsome tip – and to be sure, you will receive a bigger one. The waiter relieved at the turn of the situation had taken and heartened by the promise of the big tip, went to the restaurant’s kitchen to supervise personally the making of the coffee. The brown gentlemen spoke such excellent French, he surely must be a rich potentiate or Maharajah from the Far East. There was really nothing to fear about the bill, so he mused. Back at the table, the Filipinos were demanding an explanation. Rizal was silent, his brown eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement. “Now, you’re making it worse,” upbraided the hot-tempered Luna. “You know we all have no money and still you ordered coffee and brandy to say nothing of the big tips you promised the cook and the waiter. Why do you want to disgrace us all? Are you a fool?” “No,” was Rizal’s laconic answer. To the great amazement of Luna and the others, Rizal took out from his coat pocket a portable water color set, and serenely began to paint a 10-pound sterling note on the porcelain platter. Dexterously, with a few master strokes he finished an astounding replica of the note before the arrival of the steaming coffee and the brandy. “My good fellow,” Rizal told the smiling waiter. Pointing to the platter: “There’s the payment for all we have taken. You may keep the change.” The waiter’s eyes lit up. Bowing low in the best tradition of a French waiter acknowledging an unusually good tip, the waiter was full of effusive thanks. “Monsieur is most generous, Merci!” reaching for the platter he bowed out with many sonorous kiss of his fingertips. Calmly, Rizal started to sip his coffee and brandy while enjoying the amazement on the faces of his compatriots who all held their breaths while waiting for what inevitably would happen next.

                            24. Rizal’s Letter: To the Young Women of Malolos(excerpt)When I wrote Noli Me Tangere, I asked myself whether bravery was a common thing in the young women of our people. I brought back to my recollection and reviewed those I had known since my infancy, but there were only few who seem to come up to my ideal. There was, it is true, an abundance of girls with agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but there was in all an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so called “spiritual fathers” (as if the spirit or soul had any father other than God), due to excessive kindness, modesty, or perhaps ignorance. They seemed faded plants sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap.However, when the news of what happened at Malolos reached us, I saw my error, and great was my rejoicing. After all, who is to blame me? I did not know Malolos nor its young women, except one called Emila [Emilia Tiongson, whom Rizal met in 1887], and her I knew by name only.Now that you have responded to our first appeal in the interest of the welfare of the people; now that you have set an example to those who, like you, long to have their eyes opened and be delivered from servitude, new hopes are awakened in us and we now even dare to face adversity, because we have you for our allies and are confident of victory. No longer does the Filipina stand with her head bowed nor does she spend her time on her knees, because she is quickened by hope in the future; no longer will the mother contribute to keeping her daughter in darkness and bring her up in contempt and moral annihilation. And no longer will the science of all sciences consist in blind submission to any unjust order, or in extreme complacency, nor will a courteous smile be deemed the only weapon against insult or humble tears the ineffable panacea for all tribulations. You know that the will of God is different from that of the priest; that religiousness does not consist of long periods spent on your knees, nor in endless prayers, big rosarios, and grimy scapularies [religious garment showing devotion], but in a spotless conduct, firm intention, and upright judgment. You also know that prudence does not consist in blindly obeying any whim of the little tin god, but in obeying only that which is reasonable and just, because blind obedience is itself the cause and origin of those whims, and those guilty of it are really to be blamed. The official or friar can no longer assert that they alone are responsible for their unjust orders, because God gave each individual reason and a will of his or her own to distinguish the just from the unjust; all were born without shackles and free, and nobody has a right to subjugate the will and the spirit of another your thoughts. And, why should you submit to another your thoughts, seeing that thought is noble and free?THIS SUBJECT IS "21ST CENTURY LITERATURE"Question:Base on the first paragraph, how did jose rizal describe the filipino wowen?​</h2><br />
                        <p>In the first paragraph of the letter "To the Young Women of Malolos," Jose Rizal described the young women of his time as having agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but with an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so-called "spiritual fathers." He also remarked that they seemed faded plants sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap. Rizal observed that the young women of his time lacked bravery and seemed to be living in servitude, which was due to excessive kindness, modesty, or perhaps ignorance. He was looking for young women who would come up to his ideal, and at first, he thought there were only a few.</p><br />

                            30. As the dismaying predicament seemed beyond solution, Rizal’s nimble brain conceived a cute solution. Appearing perfectly at ease, he turned to the waiter and said, “My dear fellow,” he spoke in French, “don’t you worry.” Pointing to Luna with a flourish of his hand, he said, “Monsieur is quite right. I am the host of this party and I will take care of everything. But first, let my guests complete their meal. We must have black coffee and the best brandy the house can offer. I want the coffee to be freshly brewed. Tell the chef to boil it slowly and nicely. I’ll give him a handsome tip – and to be sure, you will receive a bigger one. The waiter relieved at the turn of the situation had taken and heartened by the promise of the big tip, went to the restaurant’s kitchen to supervise personally the making of the coffee. The brown gentlemen spoke such excellent French, he surely must be a rich potentiate or Maharajah from the Far East. There was really nothing to fear about the bill, so he mused. Back at the table, the Filipinos were demanding an explanation. Rizal was silent, his brown eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement. “Now, you’re making it worse,” upbraided the hot-tempered Luna. “You know we all have no money and still you ordered coffee and brandy to say nothing of the big tips you promised the cook and the waiter. Why do you want to disgrace us all? Are you a fool?” “No,” was Rizal’s laconic answer. To the great amazement of Luna and the others, Rizal took out from his coat pocket a portable water color set, and serenely began to paint a 10-pound sterling note on the porcelain platter. Dexterously, with a few master strokes he finished an astounding replica of the note before the arrival of the steaming coffee and the brandy. “My good fellow,” Rizal told the smiling waiter. Pointing to the platter: “There’s the payment for all we have taken. You may keep the change.” The waiter’s eyes lit up. Bowing low in the best tradition of a French waiter acknowledging an unusually good tip, the waiter was full of effusive thanks. “Monsieur is most generous, Merci!” reaching for the platter he bowed out with many sonorous kiss of his fingertips. Calmly, Rizal started to sip his coffee and brandy while enjoying the amazement on the faces of his compatriots who all held their breaths while waiting for what inevitably would happen next.
