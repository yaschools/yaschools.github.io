De laCosta's Rizal emerges as an outstanding moral figure whose devotion to the truth made his novels a sourceof moral as well as social and political wisdom for Filipinos. Although subsequent drafts show he was forcedby an unknown interlocutor to temper this view, he retained an essentially positive reading of the novels. Inthe face of Recto's 1956 bill imposing the novels, however, Archbishop (Abp.) Rufino J. Santoscommissioned Father (Fr.) Jesus Cavanna to draft a new "Statement." Beginning with a few positiveparagraphs from De la Costa, the "Statement" then absolutely condemned the novels and forbade theirreading, a prohibition that proved quite ineffective. The drafts of De la Costa show that there was within theCatholic Church a totally different attitude toward Rizal, whose legacy the church could embrace.paki explain to ng tagalog :( thank you!</a>

                                            Lesson 12: MAT WEAVING ( pp. 174-175)
➢A mat, banig in Tagalog, is used for
sleeping or sitting on the floor.
➢Banig or brown mat is a traditional
hand-woven mat.
➢ Banig weaving is a genuine treasure
handed down as a tradition or a trade
from one generation to another as it is
widely practiced in the country.
❖In Basey, Samar in the Visayas, weaving has become
one of the major source of livelihood.
❖People of Basey make fine woven mats which are made
of tikog leaves, a special reed grass which grow in
swampy areas along fields. The leaves are dyed with
different strong colors to make beautiful, colorful and
unique designs.
❖Local weavers are usually housewives who want to
have another source of income for the family. They are
traditionally called paraglara.
❖The Samals of the Sulu Archipelago also make their own
mats made of buri leaves.
❖One of the artistic craftsmanship of the Samal tribe in
Laminusa was awarded by the government, the
Manlilikha ng Bayan Award (National Folk Artist) in
1990.
❖The people of the island of Romblon have a unique style
for weaving their own mats that involves delicate lace-like
edges. It is also made out of buri leaves.
❖ Basketry is a form of indigenous art. Like mat weaving, it
has become a good source of living for many Filipinos
living in cultural countries.

Main organ
Kalayaan (dated January 1896, published March 1896)[3][4]
Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</a>

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

De laCosta's Rizal emerges as an outstanding moral figure whose devotion to the truth made his novels a sourceof moral as well as social and political wisdom for Filipinos. Although subsequent drafts show he was forcedby an unknown interlocutor to temper this view, he retained an essentially positive reading of the novels. Inthe face of Recto's 1956 bill imposing the novels, however, Archbishop (Abp.) Rufino J. Santoscommissioned Father (Fr.) Jesus Cavanna to draft a new "Statement." Beginning with a few positiveparagraphs from De la Costa, the "Statement" then absolutely condemned the novels and forbade theirreading, a prohibition that proved quite ineffective.

                            9. Lesson 12: MAT WEAVING ( pp. 174-175)
➢A mat, banig in Tagalog, is used for
sleeping or sitting on the floor.
➢Banig or brown mat is a traditional
hand-woven mat.
➢ Banig weaving is a genuine treasure
handed down as a tradition or a trade
from one generation to another as it is
widely practiced in the country.
❖In Basey, Samar in the Visayas, weaving has become
one of the major source of livelihood.
❖People of Basey make fine woven mats which are made
of tikog leaves, a special reed grass which grow in
swampy areas along fields. The leaves are dyed with
different strong colors to make beautiful, colorful and
unique designs.
❖Local weavers are usually housewives who want to
have another source of income for the family. They are
traditionally called paraglara.
❖The Samals of the Sulu Archipelago also make their own
mats made of buri leaves.
❖One of the artistic craftsmanship of the Samal tribe in
Laminusa was awarded by the government, the
Manlilikha ng Bayan Award (National Folk Artist) in
1990.
❖The people of the island of Romblon have a unique style
for weaving their own mats that involves delicate lace-like
edges. It is also made out of buri leaves.
❖ Basketry is a form of indigenous art. Like mat weaving, it
has become a good source of living for many Filipinos
living in cultural countries.

Kalayaan (dated January 1896, published March 1896)[3][4]
Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</h2><br />

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.
 Performers: Students of De La Salle College of St. Benilde
 Zildjian Benitez (vocals); Tim Marquez (guitarist);
 Diana Mapa (percussions)

Answer the following questions:
1. What message does the lyricist, Levi Celerio, convey in his song?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>ctto:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>the famous filipino folk song "ang pipit" has a sad story. if we will try to interpet the lyrics literally, it talks about a bird who was hit by a stone. the poor creature was unable to fly because of the pain and the severity of the injury so it fell from the tree. but before it hit the ground, it expresses its worry that another bird will be sad by the former's demise and that the man was too cruel for taking an innocent living being's life.
