                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>" I would define the baroque as that style that deliberately exhausts ( or tries to exhaust ) its own possibilities, and that borders on self-caricature. The baroque is the final and squanders it's resources." - Jorge Luis Borges<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>It can be said that Baroque is ostentatious.  It has its own set of syllogism. The defining characteristics of the Baroque style were: real or implied movement, an attempt to represent infinity, an emphasis on light and its effects, and a focus on the theatrical. A number of techniques were introduced, or further developed, by Baroque artists to accomplish these effects including quadro riportato (frescos that incorporated the illusion of being composed of a series of framed paintings), quadrature (ceiling painting), and trompe l'oeil techniques. This allowed for a blurring of the boundaries between painting, sculpture, and architecture that was signature to the movement.</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/15660376</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/10378956</p><br />
