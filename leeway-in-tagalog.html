When I saw my sister Delia, beating my dog with a stick, I felt hate heave like a caged angry beast in my chest. Out in the sun, the hair of my sister glinted like metal and, in her brown dress, she looked like a sheathed dagger. Biryuk hugged the earth and screamed but I could not bount forward not cry out to my sister. (Excerpt: The Centipede by Rony V. Diaz, https://study.com). _____8.

His sister, Susan was making honor roll again. His parents would allow her to do anything she wanted to do. Thomas was not making honor roll this time and he was not going to be allowed to do all the things he wanted to do. Poor Thomas! He would just have to study harder and get back on the honor roll. ​</a>

                                            STUATONAL ANALYSIS: The Covie-19 pandemic created so much anxiety in our society that practically all activities came to a het foreing us to understand that we needed to take action to combat the pandemic. Likewise, your Church community is inviting everyone to join in an outreach program in which everyone should contribute their talent, time, and treasure to the activity. It is inspite of the fact that we are faced with a lot of restrictions. This should be exciting for you because you know that this assignment they're asking for is your cup of tee for the reason that you've been doing this outreach activity since you were in junior high. However, because your location is currently in a MGCQ circumstance, you must remain at home. And yet your age as a grade 12 student gives you some leeway to move around and do some specific activities. Questions 1. How will you convince your parents that your active participation is needed in the Outreach activity of your community since you are currently in a MGCQ circumstance? 2 What part kind of the outreach activity do you think you could actively participate well? How do you plan to do it? 3. Knowing that your community lacks the proper protocol regarding the Covid-19 precautions, how will you address this thing to your Church leader?​</a>

                                            Recently, the Philippines has witnessed a fast-tracked policy making process for the Anti-Terrorism
Act. Proponents of the bill argue that it provides a preventive measure for terrorism and
insurgency, while critics fear the possible leeway for abuse the law would provide the government.
Using your knowledge of human rights and human dignity, would you consider the law acceptable
or not? Why?</a>

How will you convince your parents that your active participation is needed in the Outreach activity of your community since you are currently in a MGCQ circumstance? 2 What part kind of the outreach activity do you think you could actively participate well?
