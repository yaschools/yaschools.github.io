Bonifacio, in Ang Dapat Mabatid ng mga Tagalog (1896), emphasized that before the Spaniards came, the Filipinos were living in complete abundance and were able to trade with other countries. However, the Spaniards deceived Sikatuna and made him believe that they would treat Filipinos as equals. It was recognizing this deceit that stirred nationalism among the Filipinos towards the end of the Spanish rule in the Philippines.-patagalog nmn po please.. ​</a>

                                            People and ReligionDepartment of Tourism1The Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish, and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million 
as of May 2000, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. 
From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in 
appearance and culture.2The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one.3The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.4The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.5Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.6The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia. Today, it is limited to the southern region of the country.9Christianity was introduced as early as the 16th century with the coming of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.10Protestantism was introduced by the first Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who arrived with the American soldiers in 1899.11Two Filipino independent churches were organized at the turn of the century and are prominent today. These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang dugo ay isang likido sa katawan sa sistema ng sirkulasyon ng mga tao at iba pang mga vertebrates na naghahatid ng mga kinakailangang sangkap tulad ng mga sustansya at oxygen sa mga selula at nagdadala ng mga produktong metabolic na basura palayo sa parehong mga selula. Ang dugo ay binubuo ng mga selula ng dugo na sinuspinde sa plasma ng dugo.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang dugo ay isang natatanging pluidong biyolohikal na kinalalamnan ng selula ng pulang dugo (Ingles: red blood cell o RBC o erythrocyte), ng selula ng puting dugo (Ingles: leukocyte) at ng platito (Ingles: thrombocyte o platelet) na nakalutang sa masalimuot na pluidong kilala sa tawag na plasma ng dugo. Ang plasma ang likidong bahagi ng dugo, kung saan nakalutang ang mga selula ng dugo. Binubuo nito ang may 55 bahagdan ng kabuuang bulumen ng dugo.</p><p>Dinadala ang dugo sa palibot ng katawan sa pamamagitan ng mga sisidlan ng mga dugo dahil sa pagbobomba ng puso. Ibinubuga ang dugo mula sa malakas na kaliwang bentrikulo ng puso sa pamamagitan ng mga malalaking ugat patungo sa mga panlabas na tisyu at nagbabalik sa kanang atrium ng puso sa pamamagitan ng mga maliliit na ugat na pambaga. Papasok naman ngayon ang dugo sa kanang bentrikulo at padadaluyin papasok sa kaliwang bentrikulo upang mapaikot muli. Ang dugong arteryal ang siyang nagdadala ng oksihendo mula sa nalanghap na hangin sa loob ng mga baga patungo sa lahat ng mga selula ng katawan, samantalang ang dugo mula sa mga bena ang may dala ng karbong dioksido (na nalikha bilang mga produktong dumi ng metabolismo ng mga selula) patungo sa mga baga para ibuga palabas.</p><br />

                            24. It was the same point that Andres Bonifacio insisted-the blood compact was a valid agreement but Sikatuna was misled by the Spaniards in their promise of enlightenment and prosperity. Bonifacio, in Ang Dapat Mabatid ng mga Tagalog (1896), emphasized that before the Spaniards came, the Filipinos were living in complete abundance and were able to trade with other countries. However, the Spaniards deceived Sikatuna and made him believe that they would treat Filipinos as equals. It was recognizing this deceit that stirred nationalism among the Filipinos towards the end of the Spanish rule in the Philippines.-patagalog nmn po please.. ​</h2><br />

Ngunit nilinlang ng mga Kastila si Sikatuna at pinaniwala siya na tratuhin nila ang mga Pilipino bilang pantay.

                            26. People and ReligionDepartment of Tourism1The Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish, and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million 
as of May 2000, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. 
From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in 
appearance and culture.2The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one.3The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.4The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.5Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.6The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia. Today, it is limited to the southern region of the country.9Christianity was introduced as early as the 16th century with the coming of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.10Protestantism was introduced by the first Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who arrived with the American soldiers in 1899.11Two Filipino independent churches were organized at the turn of the century and are prominent today. These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1 The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino.

The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines. Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.</p><p></p><p>The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.</p><br />
