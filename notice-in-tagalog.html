I have noticed that I am quite good in teaching people. I am the tutor in every studying session I do with my friends, except for Filipino subjects, where I ask them questions and elaborating the parts they were confused in, this way of studying also helps me remember better since my memory works best when I am physically speaking. Before reaching to education, I also thought about being a medical technologist or nursing but ultimately settled for education since my family does not have enough money for the other two. But now, since COVID-19 happened, it actually helped cement the decision of being a teacher.</a>

                                            The Origin of the Stars Tagalog Legend Hundreds of years ago, some people say there were no stars. The sun was a mighty god, ruler of the day. Buan, the moon, was a rival god of the sun and desired to rule both day and night. Lihangin, god of the wind, was a friend of both the sun and the moon. One day he went to visit Araw, god of the sun, to warm himself. When they were sitting together, Araw told Lihangin that he had bad feelings toward Buan. He said that he noticed him showing during the day. This meant that Baun desired to occupy a part of Araw's kingdom. Lihangin wanted them to be good friends. He told Buan not to occupy any part of Araw's kingdom. He said that Araw was fair and just, so Buan must be, too. The moon did not pay attention to his advice. He continued to shine during the latter part of the day and sometimes during the morning. Araw could not bear it. He told Buan not to do it anymore. Buan insisted. They had a quarrel. Buan was badly hit. Parts of his body were scattered around, and these became the stars, leaving the moon without its former light. Such was the origin of the stars. drawing http://seasite2.niu.edu/philippine-folk-tales/tagalog-myths-the-origin-of-the-stars/​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) Melody is a timely arranged linear sequence of pitched sounds that the listener perceives as a single entity. Melody is one of the most basic elements of music. A note is a sound with a particular pitch and duration. String a series of notes together, one after the other, and you have a melody.</p><p></p><p>2) constructive way to express who you are and what you are feeling, especially in young children. It can often be difficult for children to say how they are feeling, primarily because they don’t know the name of the feeling they’re experiencing and instead they show us by crying, throwing temper tantrums, or having meltdowns. Emotional expression is something that must be learned, and young children can be taught basic emotions such as happy, mad, sad, and scared as early as two years old.</p><p></p><p>3) Melodies are produced through the human voice and any other instrument that produces pitches––marimbas, flutes, synthesizers, glockenspiels, guitars, etc.</p><p></p><p>4) Dynamics effects alter the volume of sound (that is, attenuate it) once it crosses the threshold. The amount it attenuates the sound is called the ratio. The higher the ratio, the more the effect will attenuate the sound.</p><p></p><p>5) Learning a musical instrument not only sustains and feeds the brain, but it also improves so many other cognitive and physical aspects of the human body. It's been widely studied and proven that learning a musical instrument improves memory; it not only improves your cognitive memory but also muscle memory as well.</p><p></p><p>6) When we sing folk songs it connects us with the generations who have come before us as well as other cultures from around the world. We follow in their footsteps and gather together because of our love for singing and dancing. Folk songs are also great because they make it so easy to teach history and culture</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            29. The Origin of the Stars Tagalog Legend Hundreds of years ago, some people say there were no stars. The sun was a mighty god, ruler of the day. Buan, the moon, was a rival god of the sun and desired to rule both day and night. Lihangin, god of the wind, was a friend of both the sun and the moon. One day he went to visit Araw, god of the sun, to warm himself. When they were sitting together, Araw told Lihangin that he had bad feelings toward Buan. He said that he noticed him showing during the day. This meant that Baun desired to occupy a part of Araw's kingdom. Lihangin wanted them to be good friends. He told Buan not to occupy any part of Araw's kingdom. He said that Araw was fair and just, so Buan must be, too. The moon did not pay attention to his advice. He continued to shine during the latter part of the day and sometimes during the morning. Araw could not bear it. He told Buan not to do it anymore. Buan insisted. They had a quarrel. Buan was badly hit. Parts of his body were scattered around, and these became the stars, leaving the moon without its former light. Such was the origin of the stars. drawing http://seasite2.niu.edu/philippine-folk-tales/tagalog-myths-the-origin-of-the-stars/​</h2><br />
