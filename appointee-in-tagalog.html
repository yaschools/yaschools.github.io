                                            introduction During the years of American colonialism and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Manuel Luis Quezon was arguably the most eminent and well-known pre-war Filipino leader. He was unmatched in his involvement in Philippine affairs during the years from 1907 until his death in 1944. Over the course of a career spanning the duration of American colonial authority in the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon possessed unrivaled knowledge of territorial politics, which culminated in his service as the Commonwealth's first president. Quezon originally fought against the United States during its invasion of the islands in the early 1900s, but with to the sheer force of his personality and natural political skill, he rapidly propelled himself into a Resident Commissioner post. He was young and brilliant politician, possessed "an ability and persistence rare and creditable to any representative in any parliament in the world," according to a political rival. In private meetings with the President and influential committee chairs, he assessed the problems and crafted legislative solutions that ultimately led to the "Jones Act of 1916," which is possibly his most cunning political triumph. Quezon was cautious of instant independence, but he worked extremely hard in the US House of Representatives to guarantee greater autonomy for his country. He once said, “Considering the time I have been here, the character of the subject, and the influences I had to fight, I feel inclined to say that I am almost surprised that I have secured so much”. Ever since he retired as a Resident Commissioner, he continued to mold the office by selecting and sometimes dismissing his appointees. Quezon was regarded as "bright but lazy," but he showed off his courageous, brash, and irritable combat style when he joined Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary forces during the revolution against Spain. Prior to turning himself in to the Americans in 1899, he was promoted from private to major. After serving six months in prison, he was released and sent back to Manila. Filipinos regard Quezon as the country's second President after Aguinaldo, despite the fact that Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary Republica Filipina was not recognized by other countries. Quezon is known as the "Father of the Republic of the Philippines" and the "Father of Filipino Independence" because of his efforts to encourage the Philippines' independence from the American administration. The Filipino people's peaceful suffrage has elevated him to that eminent position twice. When he speaks, he does so as more than just the official representative of his country. He speaks as the undisputed leader of a race that has pushed him to the top for the last two decades. make a reflection about this please I need this​</a>

                                            I. Direction: Answer the following question based on the principles of separation of powers and check and balances.Article Duterte to appoint 5 more SC justices in 2019- Edu Punay (Philippine Star)With the latest appointment of Associate Justice Henri Jean-Paul Inting, the high court currently has seven appointees of Duterte among its 15 members.The other six are Associate Justices Andres Reyes Jr., Alexander Gesmundo, Jose Reyes Jr., Ramon Paul Hernando, Rosmari Carandang and Amy Lazaro-Javier. But later this year, the President is expected to appoint five more magistrates in the SC due to the retirement of both Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin and Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio in October and Associate Justices Mariano del Castillo and Francis Jardeleza in July and September, respectively. There is also an expected vacancy once Bersamin’s replacement from the high court is appointed. By that time, there will be a total of 12 Duterte-appointed justices – a clear majority – sitting in the high tribunal that will decide on crucial cases involving the administration, including the Chico River and Kaliwa Dam loan projects with China. The SC, sitting as Presidential Electoral Tribunal, is also expected to act on the election protest of former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. against Vice President Leni Robredo from their 2016 vice presidential face-off. Duterte has actually appointed nine associate justices in the SC so far, but two of them are no longer with the Court. Samuel Martires was appointed ombudsman in July last year while Noel Tijam retired from the judiciary last January.Question:Based on what you have learned on the principles of separation of powers and check and balances, will there be a deterioration of equilibrium among the branches of government given the majority of the SC are Duterte appointees? Why or why not? (20 pts)Article 2Office of the President’s P8.2 B 2020 budget gets swift House OK- By: Pathricia Ann V. Roxas - ReporterSource: (https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1161623/office-of-the-presidents-p8-2-b-2020-budget-gets-swift-house-ok)MANILA, Philippines – Citing “traditional courtesy,” the House of Representatives’ Appropriations Committee approved the P8.2 billion proposed 2020 budget of the Office of the President (OP) in less than six minutes.Panel chairman and Davao City 3rd District Rep. Isidro Ungab cited traditional courtesy given to co-equal branches of the government when it comes to budget deliberations in swiftly approving the appropriations for President Rodrigo Duterte’s office.He said the same courtesy was accorded to the Office of the Vice President, the judiciary, and constitutional commissions.Although the approval faced no objection, Albay 1st District Rep. Edcel Lagman and Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Ferdinand Gaite manifested that they would scrutinize the OP’s budget during the plenary deliberations.Under the OP’s proposed budget for next year, some P4.5 billion was earmarked for confidential and intelligence expenses, which several Duterte administration critics had questioned. Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate linked this to a possible nationwide martial law when seen in the context of the P388 billion “war budget” of the administration.The opposition lawmaker said these funds “would be of better use” if allocated for programs “addressing the social ills that incite armed conflict” such as free land distribution, a living wage and national industrialization.The OP’s budget jumped by 21 percent compared to its 2019 budget of P6.8 billion.81 percent or P6.7 billion of the OP’s 2020 budget was earmarked for operations, specifically its presidential oversight, advisory, legal and legislative services, and executive staff services programs.The rest would go to the general administration and support for the office which includes retirement and life insurance premium and pension.The total national budget proposed for 2020 is P4.1 trillion.QUESTIONThe Appropriations Committee approved the P8.2 billion proposed 2020 budget of the Office of the President (OP) in less than six minutes. In your own opinion, is this reasonable that there is not further investigation on the proposed budget of the office of the president? Why or why not? (20 points)​</a>

                            4. introduction During the years of American colonialism and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Manuel Luis Quezon was arguably the most eminent and well-known pre-war Filipino leader. He was unmatched in his involvement in Philippine affairs during the years from 1907 until his death in 1944. Over the course of a career spanning the duration of American colonial authority in the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon possessed unrivaled knowledge of territorial politics, which culminated in his service as the Commonwealth's first president. Quezon originally fought against the United States during its invasion of the islands in the early 1900s, but with to the sheer force of his personality and natural political skill, he rapidly propelled himself into a Resident Commissioner post. He was young and brilliant politician, possessed "an ability and persistence rare and creditable to any representative in any parliament in the world," according to a political rival. In private meetings with the President and influential committee chairs, he assessed the problems and crafted legislative solutions that ultimately led to the "Jones Act of 1916," which is possibly his most cunning political triumph. Quezon was cautious of instant independence, but he worked extremely hard in the US House of Representatives to guarantee greater autonomy for his country. He once said, “Considering the time I have been here, the character of the subject, and the influences I had to fight, I feel inclined to say that I am almost surprised that I have secured so much”. Ever since he retired as a Resident Commissioner, he continued to mold the office by selecting and sometimes dismissing his appointees. Quezon was regarded as "bright but lazy," but he showed off his courageous, brash, and irritable combat style when he joined Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary forces during the revolution against Spain. Prior to turning himself in to the Americans in 1899, he was promoted from private to major. After serving six months in prison, he was released and sent back to Manila. Filipinos regard Quezon as the country's second President after Aguinaldo, despite the fact that Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary Republica Filipina was not recognized by other countries. Quezon is known as the "Father of the Republic of the Philippines" and the "Father of Filipino Independence" because of his efforts to encourage the Philippines' independence from the American administration. The Filipino people's peaceful suffrage has elevated him to that eminent position twice. When he speaks, he does so as more than just the official representative of his country. He speaks as the undisputed leader of a race that has pushed him to the top for the last two decades. make a reflection about this please I need this​</h2><br />

                            5. I. Direction: Answer the following question based on the principles of separation of powers and check and balances.Article Duterte to appoint 5 more SC justices in 2019- Edu Punay (Philippine Star)With the latest appointment of Associate Justice Henri Jean-Paul Inting, the high court currently has seven appointees of Duterte among its 15 members.The other six are Associate Justices Andres Reyes Jr., Alexander Gesmundo, Jose Reyes Jr., Ramon Paul Hernando, Rosmari Carandang and Amy Lazaro-Javier. But later this year, the President is expected to appoint five more magistrates in the SC due to the retirement of both Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin and Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio in October and Associate Justices Mariano del Castillo and Francis Jardeleza in July and September, respectively. There is also an expected vacancy once Bersamin’s replacement from the high court is appointed. By that time, there will be a total of 12 Duterte-appointed justices – a clear majority – sitting in the high tribunal that will decide on crucial cases involving the administration, including the Chico River and Kaliwa Dam loan projects with China. The SC, sitting as Presidential Electoral Tribunal, is also expected to act on the election protest of former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. against Vice President Leni Robredo from their 2016 vice presidential face-off. Duterte has actually appointed nine associate justices in the SC so far, but two of them are no longer with the Court. Samuel Martires was appointed ombudsman in July last year while Noel Tijam retired from the judiciary last January.Question:Based on what you have learned on the principles of separation of powers and check and balances, will there be a deterioration of equilibrium among the branches of government given the majority of the SC are Duterte appointees? Why or why not? (20 pts)Article 2Office of the President’s P8.2 B 2020 budget gets swift House OK- By: Pathricia Ann V. Roxas - ReporterSource: (https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1161623/office-of-the-presidents-p8-2-b-2020-budget-gets-swift-house-ok)MANILA, Philippines – Citing “traditional courtesy,” the House of Representatives’ Appropriations Committee approved the P8.2 billion proposed 2020 budget of the Office of the President (OP) in less than six minutes.Panel chairman and Davao City 3rd District Rep. Isidro Ungab cited traditional courtesy given to co-equal branches of the government when it comes to budget deliberations in swiftly approving the appropriations for President Rodrigo Duterte’s office.He said the same courtesy was accorded to the Office of the Vice President, the judiciary, and constitutional commissions.Although the approval faced no objection, Albay 1st District Rep. Edcel Lagman and Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Ferdinand Gaite manifested that they would scrutinize the OP’s budget during the plenary deliberations.Under the OP’s proposed budget for next year, some P4.5 billion was earmarked for confidential and intelligence expenses, which several Duterte administration critics had questioned. Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate linked this to a possible nationwide martial law when seen in the context of the P388 billion “war budget” of the administration.The opposition lawmaker said these funds “would be of better use” if allocated for programs “addressing the social ills that incite armed conflict” such as free land distribution, a living wage and national industrialization.The OP’s budget jumped by 21 percent compared to its 2019 budget of P6.8 billion.81 percent or P6.7 billion of the OP’s 2020 budget was earmarked for operations, specifically its presidential oversight, advisory, legal and legislative services, and executive staff services programs.The rest would go to the general administration and support for the office which includes retirement and life insurance premium and pension.The total national budget proposed for 2020 is P4.1 trillion.QUESTIONThe Appropriations Committee approved the P8.2 billion proposed 2020 budget of the Office of the President (OP) in less than six minutes. In your own opinion, is this reasonable that there is not further investigation on the proposed budget of the office of the president? Why or why not? (20 points)​</h2><br />
