                                            ACTIVITY 2 Instructions: The paragraph below contains assertion in one of its sentences. Underline the sentence that shows assertion and explain why you have chosen it. (10 pts) Cudjoe's dream suggests the way that racial vio- lence steals potential from the youths that play bas- ketball on Philadelphia's inner-city courts. In his dream, Cudjoe envisions a black you hanging from a basketball rim: "a boy is lynched from the rim. A kid [is] hanging there" (93). The irony in this scene stems from the usual cultural association of "hanging on the rim" with an accomplishment, a display of one's tal- ents on the court. The youth in Wideman's novel as- pires to excel, but this aspiration is not just thwarted, it is linked symbolically with the violent death of a racial hate crime. Sorrowfully, Cudjoe further comments that "if they had waited a little longer, his legs would have grown, his feet would have reached the ground and he'd be OK" (94). This statement hints at wasted potential, potential that could have led the hanged youth into adulthood. The image of the legs being almost, but not quite, long enough to touch the ground suggests an untimely, unnecessary destruc- tion. With more time, this child could have gained so much from the game: self-confidence, admiration of friends, perhaps even a scholarship. But instead of being rewarded with the glory that comes with "hanging on the rim," this young man is "rewarded" with his own death, the ultimate end to potential.​</a>

                                            PAHELP PO PA SUMMARY LANG PLSInvestigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was murdered by a car bomb on October 16 2017, near her home in northern Malta. For years she had been reporting on a web of corruption and money laundering on the Mediterranean islands, involving places as far away as Shanghai, London, Baku and Dubai. One of the many things brought under the spotlight by Caruana Galizia’s assassination was the way that she and other journalists had been endlessly threatened with costly transnational lawsuits by the people they were covering. While she had continued reporting on her blog, many of her peers were either heavily redacting their stories or simply didn’t run them. When the rich and powerful use frivolous or unfounded claims to thwart those daring to expose corruption, it is known as strategic litigation against public participation (Slapp). They often do this using libel law, though sometimes also deploy other legal areas including negligence, trespass and trademark infringement. Slapp includes both legal threats and actions, as well as generally using legal procedures to suppress activities in which there is a public interest. Caruana Galizia’s murder has prompted numerous efforts across Europe to prevent these practices. In April 2022 the European Commission proposed an anti-Slapp directive in which unfounded proceedings would be dismissed early and quickly by EU courts. The UK government began a consultation on similar legislation a couple of months later for England and Wales, while their regulatory body for solicitors cautioned members against representing such actions.​</a>

Esplanada - @inquirerdotnetPhilippine Daily Inquirer / 03:42 AM August 20, 2015HAPPY 137TH, MLQ President Aquino gently leads Zenaida Quezon Avanceña, President Manuel L. Quezon’s daughter, into the Quezon museum on Elliptical Road, Quezon City. The “Museo ni Manuel L. Quezon” at Quezon Memorial Shrine was inaugurated Wednesday in time for the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, the president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 1935 to 1944. PHOTO BY AURO MONTELLANO JR. AND GIL NARTEA/MALACAÑANG PHOTO BUREAUBetter late than never.The late President Manuel L. Quezon has been finally recognized for his “open door” policy during the Commonwealth period, which allowed the entry into the country of more than 1,300 Jewish refugees fleeing the horrors of Nazism under then German leader Adolf Hitler.During simple rites at Quezon Memorial Circle, the Philippine leader was awarded Wednesday the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation (RWF) Medal for his “life-saving plan” and for “reaching out to the victims of the Nazi murderous machine.”Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who saved an undisclosed number of Jews and persecuted people in Hungary during the Holocaust. His death while under Soviet captivity has been the subject of controversy.Internet connection problem cuts off Palace briefing on telco servicesThe medal was handed to Ma. Zenaida “Nini” Quezon Avanceña, daughter of Quezon, by Effie Ben-Matityau, Israel’s ambassador to the Philippines, and Lee Blumenthal, board member of the Jewish Association of the Philippines.President Aquino and other government officials attended the ceremony at the newly renovated Quezon Museum, which was formerly the Quezon ancestral home in New Manila, Quezon City. It was transported piece by piece to Quezon Memorial Circle.Monumental projectIn a statement, the RWF said Quezon’s “original life-saving plans were more ambitious and far reaching.”“In fact, he wanted to absorb some 100,000 Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe. However, his monumental project was thwarted by the outbreak of World War II and the Japanese invasion of the Philippines.”The group, which has offices in Jerusalem, Buenos Aires and New York, cited Quezon for epitomizing the “spirit of civic courage and solidarity exemplified by Raoul Wallenberg and all the men and women who reached out to the Nazi victims.”The RWF noted that “more than 300 heads of state, Nobel Prize laureates and distinguished personalities from all walks of life are honorary members of the foundation.”“One of the first to join its ranks was the then Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Mario Bergoglio, better known today as Pope Francis,” it added.The RWF event coincided with the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, described by Malacañang as “one of the many Filipinos who not only dedicated their careers to service but also led a life worthy of example.”“His accomplishments as a statesman include the ratification of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which led to Philippine self-government and eventual independence from the United States. Also among his legacies are his advocacy of women’s suffrage and the institutionalization of Filipino as our national language,” the Palace said.It added that Quezon’s “beliefs on the importance of moral and civic virtue are encapsulated in his Code of Citizenship and Ethics.”​</a>

                            4. BUSINESS MARKETING:Staples and The Limited have attempted to thwart shoppers who abuse store return policies. When a customer returns items, store clerks swipe the customer’s driver’s license through electronic card readers that track buying and return patterns for any suspicious activity. What drawbacks do you think such a strategy could have? ​</h2><br />
                        What is store return policy?<p>An item's return period, condition requirements, receipt requirements, and whether a consumer will receive cash or shop credit are all specified in the <strong>return policy</strong>. Without a return policy, there may be disputes regarding the circumstances under which items may be exchanged or returned to a store.</p><p></p>Advantages of Free Return PolicyNumerous studies conducted throughout the years have linked free returns to higher spending at certain merchants. One Washington &amp; Lee University study discovered that <strong>after a free-return policy was implemented, average spending climbed significantly</strong>. Conversely, when buyers were required to cover their own shipping costs as part of the return, sales dropped by 74% to 100%.Customers definitely adore it and certainly detest having to pay for any portion of the return, making this one of the more obvious<strong> benefits of free returns.</strong> A significant portion of people consider this to be crucial when deciding where to purchase.<strong>Free return shipping</strong> is provided by over 60% of shops, and this percentage rises around the holidays. Your rivals will do it if you don't.If you discover significant problems with some aspects of free returns, be aware that many companies have had success imposing modest restrictions on it. Perhaps<strong> free returns are only available to certain categories</strong>, to loyalty program members exclusively, or only during particular peak times of the year.<p></p>Disadvantages of Free Return PolicyIn fact, <strong>offering free returns will encourage some customers to try and take advantage of you</strong> by doing things like using an item once or twice before returning it. However, these expenses are usually worthwhile.<strong>Free returns don't always produce the same results for all businesses.</strong> Before making any major changes, it's crucial to try them out or do customer research.<strong>Free returns can reduce short-term gains</strong>, particularly if you're switching from a less lenient policy.<p></p>How is the return process handled with electronic cards?<p>When a cardholder transaction has been settled and documented with a post date, which is established for all categories of credit card transactions including <strong>purchases, payments, refunds, and chargebacks</strong>, it is said to have occurred electronically.</p><p></p><p>When a cardholder uses their card to make a purchase, clearing and settlement activities take place as a result. Other types of transactions may also happen and will also be reported and itemized on a cardholder's account in addition to regular purchases. <strong>Refunds or chargebacks </strong>might be considered non-standard transactions.</p><p></p><p>To learn more about store return policy, just click the link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/19226218</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/7566692</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                            7. ACTIVITY 2 Instructions: The paragraph below contains assertion in one of its sentences. Underline the sentence that shows assertion and explain why you have chosen it. (10 pts) Cudjoe's dream suggests the way that racial vio- lence steals potential from the youths that play bas- ketball on Philadelphia's inner-city courts. In his dream, Cudjoe envisions a black you hanging from a basketball rim: "a boy is lynched from the rim. A kid [is] hanging there" (93). The irony in this scene stems from the usual cultural association of "hanging on the rim" with an accomplishment, a display of one's tal- ents on the court. The youth in Wideman's novel as- pires to excel, but this aspiration is not just thwarted, it is linked symbolically with the violent death of a racial hate crime. Sorrowfully, Cudjoe further comments that "if they had waited a little longer, his legs would have grown, his feet would have reached the ground and he'd be OK" (94). This statement hints at wasted potential, potential that could have led the hanged youth into adulthood. The image of the legs being almost, but not quite, long enough to touch the ground suggests an untimely, unnecessary destruc- tion. With more time, this child could have gained so much from the game: self-confidence, admiration of friends, perhaps even a scholarship. But instead of being rewarded with the glory that comes with "hanging on the rim," this young man is "rewarded" with his own death, the ultimate end to potential.​</h2><br />

                            11. PAHELP PO PA SUMMARY LANG PLSInvestigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was murdered by a car bomb on October 16 2017, near her home in northern Malta. For years she had been reporting on a web of corruption and money laundering on the Mediterranean islands, involving places as far away as Shanghai, London, Baku and Dubai. One of the many things brought under the spotlight by Caruana Galizia’s assassination was the way that she and other journalists had been endlessly threatened with costly transnational lawsuits by the people they were covering. While she had continued reporting on her blog, many of her peers were either heavily redacting their stories or simply didn’t run them. When the rich and powerful use frivolous or unfounded claims to thwart those daring to expose corruption, it is known as strategic litigation against public participation (Slapp). They often do this using libel law, though sometimes also deploy other legal areas including negligence, trespass and trademark infringement. Slapp includes both legal threats and actions, as well as generally using legal procedures to suppress activities in which there is a public interest. Caruana Galizia’s murder has prompted numerous efforts across Europe to prevent these practices. In April 2022 the European Commission proposed an anti-Slapp directive in which unfounded proceedings would be dismissed early and quickly by EU courts. The UK government began a consultation on similar legislation a couple of months later for England and Wales, while their regulatory body for solicitors cautioned members against representing such actions.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The death of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia has been a wake-up call to many countries around the world, prompting a push for legislation to prevent strategic litigation against public participation (Slapp). The European Commission proposed an anti-Slapp directive in April 2022, and the UK government began a consultation for England and Wales a couple of months later. The directive would see unfounded proceedings quickly dismissed by EU courts, and the regulatory body for solicitors cautioned members against representing such actions. Such legislation is necessary to protect journalists and other public figures from the threat of costly lawsuits that are used to silence them. Such lawsuits are often filed with the intention of intimidating those who are speaking out against corruption or other wrongdoings, and this type of legal action must be stopped in order to ensure that justice can be served.</p><p></p><br />

Quezon’s daughter, into the Quezon museum on Elliptical Road, Quezon City. The “Museo ni Manuel L. Quezon” at Quezon Memorial Shrine was inaugurated Wednesday in time for the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, the president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 1935 to 1944. PHOTO BY AURO MONTELLANO JR. AND GIL NARTEA/MALACAÑANG PHOTO BUREAUBetter late than never.The late President Manuel L. Quezon has been finally recognized for his “open door” policy during the Commonwealth period, which allowed the entry into the country of more than 1,300 Jewish refugees fleeing the horrors of Nazism under then German leader Adolf Hitler.During simple rites at Quezon Memorial Circle, the Philippine leader was awarded Wednesday the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation (RWF) Medal for his “life-saving plan” and for “reaching out to the victims of the Nazi murderous machine.”Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who saved an undisclosed number of Jews and persecuted people in Hungary during the Holocaust. His death while under Soviet captivity has been the subject of controversy.Internet connection problem cuts off Palace briefing on telco servicesThe medal was handed to Ma. Zenaida “Nini” Quezon Avanceña, daughter of Quezon, by Effie Ben-Matityau, Israel’s ambassador to the Philippines, and Lee Blumenthal, board member of the Jewish Association of the Philippines.President Aquino and other government officials attended the ceremony at the newly renovated Quezon Museum, which was formerly the Quezon ancestral home in New Manila, Quezon City. It was transported piece by piece to Quezon Memorial Circle.Monumental projectIn a statement, the RWF said Quezon’s “original life-saving plans were more ambitious and far reaching.”“In fact, he wanted to absorb some 100,000 Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe. However, his monumental project was thwarted by the outbreak of World War II and the Japanese invasion of the Philippines.”The group, which has offices in Jerusalem, Buenos Aires and New York, cited Quezon for epitomizing the “spirit of civic courage and solidarity exemplified by Raoul Wallenberg and all the men and women who reached out to the Nazi victims.”The RWF noted that “more than 300 heads of state, Nobel Prize laureates and distinguished personalities from all walks of life are honorary members of the foundation.”“One of the first to join its ranks was the then Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Mario Bergoglio, better known today as Pope Francis,” it added.The RWF event coincided with the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, described by Malacañang as “one of the many Filipinos who not only dedicated their careers to service but also led a life worthy of example.”“His accomplishments as a statesman include the ratification of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which led to Philippine self-government and eventual independence from the United States. Also among his legacies are his advocacy of women’s suffrage and the institutionalization of Filipino as our national language,” the Palace said.It added that Quezon’s “beliefs on the importance of moral and civic virtue are encapsulated in his Code of Citizenship and Ethics.”​</h2><br />
