Actually, the Paombong word was derived from bumbong (a container made of bamboo). The old way of fermenting the vinegar (suka) was through this container. Sukang Paombong is one of the well-known products of Bulacan. Paombong has a vast plantation of sasâ or nipa palm. This plant is usually found along the estuary where salt water and fresh water flow. From its matured (bungang sasa) nipa palm fruits, these fruits are being spurned for one week to produce more juice and it is locally termed as pagsikad. First, tuba gatherers (manunubâ) used sharp knife to grate the end bent of the sasâ branch. Second, a bumbong will be used as the container of the sasâ juice when it comes out. Next, gathered sasâ juice will be transferred into a large container called "tapayan" (earthen jar) after two or three weeks of that process. Then, they will use a strainer to eliminate the dregs from the juice. Finally, after weeks of fermenting the vinegar in the container, sukang Paombong will be tasted and now is ready to be arranged right in your dining table.Tittle__________Author___________Setting___________Characters___________Event/s__________Theme_________nonsense report​</a>

                                            would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</a>

A Sour Process                  Jon-Jon Surio Reyes Suka is the tagalog term for vinegar and Paombong is a place in Bulacan where earlier Spaniards named the town because of its huge area planted with bamboo. Actually, the Paombong word was derived from bumbong (a container made of bamboo). The old way of fermenting the vinegar (suka) was through this container. Sukang Paombong is one of the well-known products of Bulacan. Paombong has a vast plantation of sasâ or nipa palm. This plant is usually found along the estuary where salt water and fresh water flow. From its matured (bungang sasa) nipa palm fruits, these fruits are being spurned for one week to produce more juice and it is locally termed as pagsikad. First, tuba gatherers (manunubâ) used sharp knife to grate the end bent of the sasâ branch. Second, a bumbong will be used as the container of the sasâ juice when it comes out. Next, gathered sasâ juice will be transferred into a large container called "tapayan" (earthen jar) after two or three weeks of that process. Then, they will use a strainer to eliminate the dregs from the juice. Finally, after weeks of fermenting the vinegar in the container, sukang Paombong will be tasted and now is ready to be arranged right in your dining table.Tittle__________Author___________Setting___________Characters___________Event/s__________Theme_________nonsense report​</h2><br />

                            20. would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</h2><br />
