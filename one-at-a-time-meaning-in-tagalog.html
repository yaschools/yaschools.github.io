                                            FOUR VALUES IN FILIPINO DRAMA AND FILMNicanor G. Tiongson(1) THERE IS NO doubt that cinema has risen as one of the most popular means ofmass communication in contemporary Philippines. Movie theaters dot cities, townsand other important commercial centers from Aparri to Jolo. Through thesetheaters, Nora Aunor has truly become a national figure and tagalog has risen tothe status of a real national language. Indeed, movie theaters have become asimportant to us today as churches were in the last century.(2) Because movies have become one of the most important means ofcommunication, it is high time that the Filipinos examined the values encounteredin and propagated by, the movies. These values at the general worldview arisingfrom them inevitably mold the Filipino's consciousness for better or for worse, in aneffective, if insidious, manner through stories that entertain.(3) Sad to say, the principal values encountered in most Filipino movies today arethe same negative values they have inherited from the traditional dramas whichmigrated, so to speak, from stage to screen, and provided the latter, for the longesttime, with both form, content and most of all, world-view. Four of these valueswhich we must single out for their prevalence, perseverance and perniciousnessmay ne encapsulated in the following statements: 1) Maganda ang Maputi (White isbeautiful), 2) Masaya ang may Palabas (Shows are the best), 3) Mabuti ang Inaapi(Hurrah for the Underdog!), and 4) Maganda pa ang Daigdig (All is Right with theworld)Comprehension Guide Questions: 3 points each1.

                                            inequality in one variable. History of Carmona In the late 16th century, a Spanish colonial resettlement program was implemented across wide areas of what came to be known as the province of (EXAMPLE) CAVITE. The program was designed to integrate the Filipinos into the religious and political institutions of the Spaniards. (1)__________ was first established as a mission town in 1595. Together with the other mission towns in the province, it became one of the centers of religious and economic activities in the first centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Carmona used to be a barrio of the Mission Town of Silang. It was locally known as "(2)_____________ "", a tagalog word for plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. At that time, this barrio was just a small farming community with a very small population. As its population rapidly increased, religious and political separation from the town of Silang was later sought from Spain. Eventually, it became an independent municipality on February 20, 1857 by virtue of the Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de (5)__________ The name (3_______) was adopted as a sign of gratitude to the Spanish officials who influenced the Central Government at the time of separation of the barrio. With boundaries properly delineated and a church established, it started its own religious and political administration. The people of Carmona have actively participated in the revolution against the Spaniards. It also witnessed the Filipinos' resistance against the Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation, some of Carmona's prominent houses were used as Japanese headquarters while the hills became the stronghold of Filipino revolutionaries After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions or land conflicts.​</a>

Let us make a Concept Map about the measures of central tendency and use the numbers shown from the cards to identify the mean, median, mode, range, and interquartile range. Solution: The picture above illustrates the tabletop game using cards. This game is called Solitaire (Solitaryo in tagalog ay larong nagsasanay ng utak) and can be played by one person. This is popular among people even in the old times, particularly in a remote area. In San Pablo City, we can observe our grandparents playing these tabletop game cards solely while resting after a hard time working from the farm. Solitaire is an excellent way to diffuse any tension in one's mind or body and helps the person enjoys the day or get to sleep better at night; enough sleep keeps the body healthy. It gives the mind something to focus on, particularly in times of low action when the opportunity to fret is high, Let us use the number in each card in reviewing the concepts about the measures of central tendency and variability These numbers are :7.10,8, 4, 6,3,7 By Concept Mapping you can easily organize your knowledge learned from the previous lessons you had when you were in grade 8 CONCEPT MAP द/ average highest frequency MEAN MODE Measures of Central Tendency​</a>

Tiongson(1) THERE IS NO doubt that cinema has risen as one of the most popular means ofmass communication in contemporary Philippines. Movie theaters dot cities, townsand other important commercial centers from Aparri to Jolo. Through thesetheaters, Nora Aunor has truly become a national figure and tagalog has risen tothe status of a real national language. Indeed, movie theaters have become asimportant to us today as churches were in the last century.(2) Because movies have become one of the most important means ofcommunication, it is high time that the Filipinos examined the values encounteredin and propagated by, the movies. These values at the general worldview arisingfrom them inevitably mold the Filipino's consciousness for better or for worse, in aneffective, if insidious, manner through stories that entertain.(3) Sad to say, the principal values encountered in most Filipino movies today arethe same negative values they have inherited from the traditional dramas whichmigrated, so to speak, from stage to screen, and provided the latter, for the longesttime, with both form, content and most of all, world-view. Four of these valueswhich we must single out for their prevalence, perseverance and perniciousnessmay ne encapsulated in the following statements: 1) Maganda ang Maputi (White isbeautiful), 2) Masaya ang may Palabas (Shows are the best), 3) Mabuti ang Inaapi(Hurrah for the Underdog!), and 4) Maganda pa ang Daigdig (All is Right with theworld)Comprehension Guide Questions: 3 points each1.

Solution: The picture above illustrates the tabletop game using cards. This game is called Solitaire (Solitaryo in tagalog ay larong nagsasanay ng utak) and can be played by one person. This is popular among people even in the old times, particularly in a remote area. In San Pablo City, we can observe our grandparents playing these tabletop game cards solely while resting after a hard time working from the farm. Solitaire is an excellent way to diffuse any tension in one's mind or body and helps the person enjoys the day or get to sleep better at night; enough sleep keeps the body healthy. It gives the mind something to focus on, particularly in times of low action when the opportunity to fret is high, Let us use the number in each card in reviewing the concepts about the measures of central tendency and variability These numbers are :7.10,8, 4, 6,3,7 By Concept Mapping you can easily organize your knowledge learned from the previous lessons you had when you were in grade 8 CONCEPT MAP द/ average highest frequency MEAN MODE Measures of Central Tendency​</h2><br />
