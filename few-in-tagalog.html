Your score is The People of the Philippines by the Philippine Tourism Promotions Board (1) Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 70 million, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders evolved the people of a unique blend of east and west, both in appearance and culture, The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for are said to be taken from Malay forefathers. (2) The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16 century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one. (3) Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions. Each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayas from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. (4) Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 11l dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups Some 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain's lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and these people can be found basically in Mindanao. (5) The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christian demonstrations and Buddhist.​</a>

                                            would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</a>

                                            A. The lyrics are according to the native tongue.Because songs are based on the daily experiences of the people in a particularplace and the message of the songs needs to be understood easily to be appreciated.the lyrics of the songs are written or sung in their own dialects. For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog. (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andPamulinawen). The Kapampangan's Atin Cu Pung Singsing, and the Bicolano'sSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirown dialects. Why do you think it is important for a folk song to be sung or writtenin their native tongue?​</a>

De laCosta's Rizal emerges as an outstanding moral figure whose devotion to the truth made his novels a sourceof moral as well as social and political wisdom for Filipinos. Although subsequent drafts show he was forcedby an unknown interlocutor to temper this view, he retained an essentially positive reading of the novels. Inthe face of Recto's 1956 bill imposing the novels, however, Archbishop (Abp.) Rufino J. Santoscommissioned Father (Fr.) Jesus Cavanna to draft a new "Statement." Beginning with a few positiveparagraphs from De la Costa, the "Statement" then absolutely condemned the novels and forbade theirreading, a prohibition that proved quite ineffective. The drafts of De la Costa show that there was within theCatholic Church a totally different attitude toward Rizal, whose legacy the church could embrace.paki explain to ng tagalog :( thank you!</a>

The lyrics are according to the native tongue.Because songs are based on the daily experiences of the peoplein aplace and the message of the songs needs to be understood easily to be appreciated,the lyrics of the songs are written or sung in their own dialects. For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirPamulinawen). The Kapampangan's Atin Cu Pung Singsing, and the Bicolano'sown dialects. Why do you think it is important for a folk song to be sung or writtenin their native tongue?B. Passed down through oral tradition to family or community members, hence,learned by mere memorizationSinging is a form of social bonding among early Filipino families. Because theydid not have access to internet, T.V. and radio during that time, singing folksongsbecame their favorite pastime.C. Unknown composers and lyricistsMost composers of Filipino folk songs are unknown because songs are justbased on daily experiences and are passed down orally.D. Simple key signature of the songDo you know how to play a guitar? If you can play this instrument, you cantry to play a simple folk song. While playing, you will notice that it starts with aparticular key (key of G for example) and ends in that same key. That only shows thesimplicity of the Luzon folk songs.E. Duple, triple, or, quadruple are common meters usedThese meters were very common during that time. The dances and commonsongs are based on these meters. The composers of the folk songs adopted theserhythmic patterns to their compositions.What folk songs do you know? Can you identify the meters used based on thediscussion in the review section of this module?F. Primarily based on the community's culture, tradition and livelihood​</a>

The Philippines has a population of 70 million, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders evolved the people of a unique blend of east and west, both in appearance and culture, The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for are said to be taken from Malay forefathers. (2) The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16 century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one. (3) Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions. Each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayas from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. (4) Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 11l dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups Some 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain's lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and these people can be found basically in Mindanao. (5) The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christian demonstrations and Buddhist.​</h2><br />

Froma long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders evolved a people ofa unique blend of east and west, both in appearance and culture.2 The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kiashi,and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be takenfrom Malay forefathers. The close familyrelations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The prousness comes from the Spaniardin de thisintroduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and thisis what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Orientalone,By the Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizableby distinct traits and dialects – thesturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the centralplains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems ofMindanao. Tribal communities canbe found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.A Some 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain's lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and thesepeople can be found basically in Mindanao. The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christiandenominations and Buddhist.5 The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background ofthe people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well.

                            12. would become one of history's most influential works of art - The Last Supper  The Last Supper is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the Eucharist, a ritual still performed.  Specifically, The Last Supper depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger, and shock. Leonardo hadn't worked on such a large painting and had no experience in the standard mural medium of fresco. The painting was made using experimental pigments directly on the dry plaster wall and unlike frescos, where the pigments are mixed with the wet plaster, it has not stood the test of time well. Even before it was finished there were problems with the paint flaking from the wall and Leonardo had to repair it. Over the years it has crumbled, been vandalized bombed and restored. Today we are probably looking at very little of the original.  Much of the recent interest in the painting has centered on the details hidden within the painting, but in directing attention to these 'hidden' details, most people miss the incredible sense of perspective the work displays. The sharp angling of the walls within the picture, which leads back to the seemingly distant back wall of the room and the windows that show the hills and sky beyond. The type of day shown through these windows adds to the feeling of serenity that rests in the center of the piece, around the figure of Christ. pa translate po sa tagalog ..​</h2><br />

</p><p>Although you can find various pictures online of the Rhinoceros Beetle, nothing can compare to seeing one up close and personal. From experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it's nearly impossible to get it off without killing it. The variety found in the Philippines is the Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle.
</p><p>
</p><p>They may seem formidable and vicious, but appearances can be deceiving. They have sharp claws, and those claws can only hurt you if you get pinched by them. Other than that, they're practically harmless. They also have horns, and there is a difference in length depending on whether it's male or female.
</p><p>
</p><p>From what I understand, it's the strongest insect in the world. I'm not willing to test that assertion.
</p><p>
</p><p>Beetles of All Kinds
</p><p>There are beetles in the Philippines that I've never seen anywhere else in the world, and I'd be lying if I told you I could name any of them. There are also beetles in the Philippines who could be considered "undocumented immigrants" from the United States, hitching rides on cargo ships and airplanes. Of course, I'm sure they come from other places as well, like Korea, Japan and China.
</p><p>
</p><p>Interestingly, a bilas of mine (a sister-in-law's husband) has a sister who was given the nickname of "Ubang" when she was young, which is short for salagubang. It took me a while to figure out it was because she was afraid of beetles when she was young, not because she looks like one (she doesn't, of course).
</p><p>
</p><p>Beetle Pest Control
</p><p>There really isn't any way to control these little creatures without causing environmental damage. They won't normally go where people go unless they're seeking a new food source (certain plants and trees). They usually only get into houses when people leave their doors open. The uwang is too big to fit under the bottom of most doors when the doors are properly closed.
</p><p>
</p><p>It's important to have bug screens on window frames and trust me, you can find houses in the Philippines with window frames only, without anything in the frames. During the cool months, windows aren't that important, but bug screens are always important, and not just to keep beetles out. I'm also talking about mosquitoes, dragonflies and praying mantises, all of which have entered my house when doors or windows were open.
</p><p>
</p><p>Years ago, one of my young nieces (a teenager today) was jumping around hysterically, crying and whining at the same time. It took a minute or more to realize which of the beetles had attached it to the backside of the t-shirt she was wearing. Removing her t-shirt from her body was far easier than removing the uwang from her t-shirt. It didn't want to let go.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            23. paki explain to ng tagalog tungkol sa RIZAL BILL 1956: HORACIO DE LA COSTA AND THE BISHOPS.Several drafts of a pastoral letter, written by Horacio de la Costa for the bishops in 1952, survive. De laCosta's Rizal emerges as an outstanding moral figure whose devotion to the truth made his novels a sourceof moral as well as social and political wisdom for Filipinos. Although subsequent drafts show he was forcedby an unknown interlocutor to temper this view, he retained an essentially positive reading of the novels. Inthe face of Recto's 1956 bill imposing the novels, however, Archbishop (Abp.) Rufino J. Santoscommissioned Father (Fr.) Jesus Cavanna to draft a new "Statement." Beginning with a few positiveparagraphs from De la Costa, the "Statement" then absolutely condemned the novels and forbade theirreading, a prohibition that proved quite ineffective. The drafts of De la Costa show that there was within theCatholic Church a totally different attitude toward Rizal, whose legacy the church could embrace.paki explain to ng tagalog :( thank you!</h2><br />

                            28. What is Itq &amp;particularFolk songs in general have the following characteristicsA. The lyrics are according to the native tongue.Because songs are based on the daily experiences of the peoplein aplace and the message of the songs needs to be understood easily to be appreciated,the lyrics of the songs are written or sung in their own dialects. For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirPamulinawen). The Kapampangan's Atin Cu Pung Singsing, and the Bicolano'sown dialects. Why do you think it is important for a folk song to be sung or writtenin their native tongue?B. Passed down through oral tradition to family or community members, hence,learned by mere memorizationSinging is a form of social bonding among early Filipino families. Because theydid not have access to internet, T.V. and radio during that time, singing folksongsbecame their favorite pastime.C. Unknown composers and lyricistsMost composers of Filipino folk songs are unknown because songs are justbased on daily experiences and are passed down orally.D. Simple key signature of the songDo you know how to play a guitar? If you can play this instrument, you cantry to play a simple folk song. While playing, you will notice that it starts with aparticular key (key of G for example) and ends in that same key. That only shows thesimplicity of the Luzon folk songs.E. Duple, triple, or, quadruple are common meters usedThese meters were very common during that time. The dances and commonsongs are based on these meters. The composers of the folk songs adopted theserhythmic patterns to their compositions.What folk songs do you know?
