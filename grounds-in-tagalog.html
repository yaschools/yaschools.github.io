                                            Why The Sky is High (Tagalog myth)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on Earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was, therefore, his father's right hand man.  He was always helping with the work in the field, and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily.  In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility.  He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the cooking.  He also pounded the palay that his father and Ingat harvested.  Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name.  Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground.  Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual.   He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.   His anger added to his strength and desire to finish the work quickly.  So he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised.  In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.  When he finished pounding rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen, and that is why it is where it is today.1.	Who are the brothers?2.	Who was careful in everything he did?3.	How did Daskol do his work?4.	Did Daskol like the work of pounding rice? Yes or no?5.	Why did Daskol become irritated while pounding rice one day? Choose the letter only.a.

                                            Please help me guys explain this in tagalog 1. The relation between individual and society is very close. Essentially, “society” is the regularities, customs and ground rules of antihuman behavior. These practices are tremendously important to know how humans act and interact with each other. Society does not exist independently without individual. 2. The individual lives and acts within society but society is nothing, in spite of the combination of individuals for cooperative effort. On the other hand, society exists to serve individuals not the other way around. Human life and society almost go together. The relationship between individual and society is ultimately one of the profound of all the problems of social philosophy.3. The ultimate goal of society is to promote good and happy life for its individuals. It creates conditions and opportunities for the all round development of individual personality. ​</a>

                            9. Why The Sky is High (Tagalog myth)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on Earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was, therefore, his father's right hand man.  He was always helping with the work in the field, and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily.  In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility.  He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the cooking.  He also pounded the palay that his father and Ingat harvested.  Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name.  Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground.  Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual.   He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.   His anger added to his strength and desire to finish the work quickly.  So he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised.  In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.  When he finished pounding rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen, and that is why it is where it is today.1.	Who are the brothers?2.	Who was careful in everything he did?3.	How did Daskol do his work?4.	Did Daskol like the work of pounding rice? Yes or no?5.	Why did Daskol become irritated while pounding rice one day? Choose the letter only.a.

                            27. Please help me guys explain this in tagalog 1. The relation between individual and society is very close. Essentially, “society” is the regularities, customs and ground rules of antihuman behavior. These practices are tremendously important to know how humans act and interact with each other. Society does not exist independently without individual. 2. The individual lives and acts within society but society is nothing, in spite of the combination of individuals for cooperative effort. On the other hand, society exists to serve individuals not the other way around. Human life and society almost go together. The relationship between individual and society is ultimately one of the profound of all the problems of social philosophy.3. The ultimate goal of society is to promote good and happy life for its individuals. It creates conditions and opportunities for the all round development of individual personality. ​</h2><br />
