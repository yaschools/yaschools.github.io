                                            In the Oracles: My Filipino Grandparents in America, Pati Poblete givesher account as a young girl growing up in America being raised by herculturally foreign grandparents, and the results reverberate with her well intoher adult years. Her parents, on the other hand, play a deafeningly silent rolethroughout the upbringing of Pati. The failure of Pati's parents to provide herwith guidance, attention and to control her exposure to popular media at ayoung age prevented her from having a healthy relationship with hergrandparents and a healthy identity. Ron Taffel, a child-rearing expert,advised: "Even as kids reach adolescence, they need more than ever for us towatch over theni. Adolescence is not about letting go. It's about hanging onduring a very bumpy ride." Pati unfortunately didn't have this support soseemed to hit every bump.-Student paper on Pati Poblete's The Oracles:My Filipino Grandparents in AmericaThesis Statement:​</a>

The Legend of Rice
Long ago, people did not plant crops or raise animals for food. The relied only on nature and their surroundings. They would live in places where they could find food. Some stayed in caves and lived on fruits and animal meat. Some stayed by riverbank and the sea so they could fish for their food. They would stay in a place until food got scarce and then move to another place where food was bountiful. The couple Banag and Danas belonged to a group who used to live near the sea. They were looking for a new place. A fierce storm had destroyed their houses near the sea. They feared the coming of another storm. “Why do we always move our home?” Banag asked Danas.” I am tired of this kind of life. We cannot even have children because we keep moving.” Banag wanted to separate from the rest of the group and stay behind in a pleasant place. “I want to bear our child there.” Danas gave in to his wife’s request. They chose a nice place in the mountains and built a simple house there. Their new home was tranquil, and food was bountiful. Nearby was a clear stream where Danas caught many fish. But then came a drought. For a long time, no rain fell, and the earth dried up. Plants and trees died, and birds and animals disappeared. Fish perished in the dried stream. Danas travelled far to look for food. But the drought was merciless. He traveled until he reached the next mountain. Still, he could not find food. Exhaustion caught up with Danas in the middle of the vast field. He lay among the grasses and fell asleep. Suddenly, the wind blew, and the grasses
danced and sang, Danas woke up surprised. Danas listened to the song of the grasses. “We are the hope of the people, Danas, gather our grains, our grains are good food.” Danas noticed the head of the grasses. Each head was full of golden grains. He picked a grain and bit it. “Pound our grains to remove their golden covers. “Sang the grasses.” Cook the white kernels inside the grains to soften them. It is good food. Danas gathered the grains until his bag was full and then hurriedly went home to Banag. “Now we have food,” he happily told Banag. He removed the golden covers of the grains, as the grasses had instructed him, cooked the grains and eat them. The next morning, Danas returned to the field, plant our grains “sang the grasses.” Plant them on land softened by rain. They will grow, and you will take care of them. When you harvest, save some grains to plant again. Learn to plant and take care of plants. Planting will become your source of livelihood.

                                            LEVEL 3: ADVANCE 	Advance your skills! 	As a critical thinker, one should know how to analyze statements and draw conclusions from them. In this way, misunderstanding can be avoided. 	Your next task is to make or draw out a claim of value from each given argument. Example:	The world has sped up over the past generation; technology has gotten more complicated and ideas more complex. Hence, higher math like Algebra should be introduced as early as grades 7 and 8. However, children in grades 7 and 8 are experiencing plateau growth. They are not in their optimal years of learning, thus the growing number of failing students. Claim of Value: It is better to introduce higher math like Algebra in grade 10 instead. 	Dealing with unruly siblings can be maddening. Sometimes, we tend to easily lose our control and we wouldn’t notice we’re already raising our voices up to our ceiling. However, yelling towards our siblings is a costly mistake. Yelling only works in the moment. It can also cause our siblings to secretly dislike us. Another is, when we yell, we only train them to listen to us only when we raise our voice. No matter how frustrated you may get with your siblings, yelling should never be or should be the least of your option/s. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	‘Dark’ is a mind-bending and meticulously crafted TV series. It is arguably the best time travel show that I have witnessed. It doesn’t limit itself to that theme alone. It also tackles quantum entanglement, parallel, and alternative universe. Predictability does not count in the series. There will always be revelations. The plot is indeed perplexing but decently maintained all throughout. Overall, I must say, it’s a great show to binge watch. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	The library is a place for readers to explore, create, relax, and simply be. It is a window to investigate and see the world. The experience transforms readers from the narrow existence of daily life to the wide world beyond our brick and mortar walls. Public libraries play a very important role in fostering the intellectual development of society. It is one of the critical links to different institutions in our society, such as schools. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	Divorce should never be legalized in our country. It is not the answer to marital problems. It threatens the sanctity of marriage. The proposition will actually increase the number of failed marriages. It can also introduce the child to destructive behavior. The existence of divorce will also mean loss of faith in marriage and family unit. Divorce takes a toll on a family’s income which may lead to poverty aggravation. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ Filipinos have been a fan of beauty pageants. Beauty pageants have been entertaining us for the past decades. 		However, I believe beauty pageants degrade women. Women in such competitions are treated as physical objects for pleasure and not as human beings. They are judged based on their physical attributes mostly. They spend more time parading in swimsuits and gowns and very little time on intelligence. Claim of Value: ​</a>

Don’t meddle with old unloaded firearms, they are the most deadly and unerring things ever created. You don’t have to take any pains with them at all; you don’t have to have a rest, you don’t have to have any sights on the gun, you don’t have to take aim even. No, you just pick out a relative and bang away, and you are sure to get him. A youth who can’t hit a cathedral at thirty yards with a Gatling gun in three-quarters of an hour, can take up an old empty musket and bag his grandmother every time at a hundred. ---Mark Twain, “Advice to Youth” In The Oracles: My Filipino Grandparents in America, Pati Poblete gives her account as a young girl growing up in America being raised by her culturally foreign grandparents, and the results reverberate with her well into her adult years. Her parents, on the other hand, play a deafeningly silent role throughout the upbringing of Pati. The failure of Pati’s parents to provide her with guidance, attention and to control her exposure to popular media at a young age prevented her from having a healthy relationship with her grandparents and a healthy identity. Ron Taffel, a child-rearing expert, advised: “Even as kids reach adolescence, they need more than ever for us to watch over them. Adolescence is not about letting go. It's about hanging on during a very bumpy ride.” Pati unfortunately didn’t have this support so seemed to hit every bump. ---Student paper on Pati Poblete’s The Oracles:My Filipino Grandparents in America In the 1940s, George Orwell warned “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past” (Orwell 30). In the 1990s a band called Rage Against the Machine, the name itself referring to a people’s movement to fight against control (corporation, government or otherwise) used this mantra in their song “Testify,” a warning to not silently endure oppression. This warning is not only relevant to the 20th century, but has been applicable since human beings started forming structures of power to control and oppress one another. This can vividly be seen during the times of slavery in the United States when blacks were enslaved for two and a half centuries. In Frederick Douglass’s novel Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Douglass reveals how this long and brutal control of human beings w​</a>

Legalize Use of Medical Marijuana Think of the hopeful possibilities, the ways by which medical marijuana may ease a patient’s, and consequently a family’s suffering, and enhance palliative care for end-stage illnesses. Physicians, nurses, and caregivers have been pushing marijuana or cannabis as a medical recourse to mitigate pain in many patients afflicted with grave illnesses and medical conditions. While further intensive research is still needed, there is much anecdotal evidence to back marijuana’s palliative qualities. It has been touted worldwide as a compassionate aid for the terminally ill and the elderly. In the House of Representatives, the recent endorsement by the committee on the health of the proposed Philippine Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act raises hope among patients, advocacy groups, and other interested parties that the measure would soon reach plenary, be improved, and approved in a vote, and ultimately, with the Senate passing its version, be streamlined and finally enacted into law. Lawmakers are crossing party lines to endorse it. Authored by Isabela Rep. Rodolfo Albano III, the bill proposes that the state “legalize and regulate the medical use of cannabis, which has been confirmed to have beneficial and therapeutic uses to treat a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition that produces one or more of the following: cachexia or wasting syndrome; severe and chronic pain; severe nausea; seizures, including but not limited to those characteristics of epilepsy; or severe and persistent muscle spasms, including but not limited to those associated with multiple sclerosis.” The proposed law would enable “medical cannabis compassionate centers” under license by the Department of Health to sell, supply, and dispense the psychoactive drug to qualified patients or their designated caregivers by a pharmacist licensed by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. The bill has met opposition from various quarters citing possible abuse. But medical marijuana has notable supporters, including President Duterte himself. “Medicinal marijuana, yes, because it is an ingredient of modern medicine. There are medicines being developed, or are now in the market that contains marijuana for medical purposes,” the President was quoted as saying in 2016. Another high-profile supporter is former health secretary Jaime Galvez Tan, who told Congress that using cannabis is “a safer and cheaper way to treat patients” suffering from epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Marijuana has long been considered the most accessible gateway drugs. The belief was that marijuana would lead users to “graduate” too dangerous drugs such as heroin and cocaine. Its users have long been demonized as “stoners” and pejoratively described as lost souls who do nothing but smoke “weed” throughout the day. This remains its stereotypical portrayal in popular culture. Explaining his measure, Albano said: “It is evident in the bill that you can’t smoke weed per se. You cannot even dispense it in its raw form and say, ‘Just use this for tea.’ It has to be in medicinal form.” In a 2012 global drug report commissioned by the United Nations, marijuana was identified as “the world’s most widely produced, trafficked, and consumed drug in the world in 2010.” Its users' number between 119 million and 224 million among adults (18 or older) in the world. It is widely illegal worldwide. The United States, where marijuana was the poster child of the Reagan-era “Just Say No” anti-drug campaign, has made a severe turnaround regarding medical marijuana. Today,its usage is legal in 33 states. Canada was the first country to make it legal in 2001, and 32 other countries have followed suit. Hopefully, the Philippines will soon be part of the enlightened list. An efficient information campaign will help Filipinos understand that medical marijuana is a humane and perhaps even a necessary tool in helping those afflicted with painful or life- threatening diseases or conditions. Legally and properly administered, it will usher in a new and helpful realm of medical possibilities​</a>

The Legend of Rice
Long ago, people did not plant crops or raise animals for food. The relied only on nature and their surroundings. They would live in places where they could find food. Some stayed in caves and lived on fruits and animal meat. Some stayed by riverbank and the sea so they could fish for their food. They would stay in a place until food got scarce and then move to another place where food was bountiful. The couple Banag and Danas belonged to a group who used to live near the sea. They were looking for a new place. A fierce storm had destroyed their houses near the sea. They feared the coming of another storm. “Why do we always move our home?” Banag asked Danas.” I am tired of this kind of life. We cannot even have children because we keep moving.” Banag wanted to separate from the rest of the group and stay behind in a pleasant place. “I want to bear our child there.” Danas gave in to his wife’s request. They chose a nice place in the mountains and built a simple house there. Their new home was tranquil, and food was bountiful. Nearby was a clear stream where Danas caught many fish. But then came a drought. For a long time, no rain fell, and the earth dried up. Plants and trees died, and birds and animals disappeared. Fish perished in the dried stream. Danas travelled far to look for food. But the drought was merciless. He traveled until he reached the next mountain. Still, he could not find food. Exhaustion caught up with Danas in the middle of the vast field. He lay among the grasses and fell asleep. Suddenly, the wind blew, and the grasses
danced and sang, Danas woke up surprised. Danas listened to the song of the grasses. “We are the hope of the people, Danas, gather our grains, our grains are good food.” Danas noticed the head of the grasses. Each head was full of golden grains. He picked a grain and bit it. “Pound our grains to remove their golden covers. “Sang the grasses.” Cook the white kernels inside the grains to soften them. It is good food. Danas gathered the grains until his bag was full and then hurriedly went home to Banag. “Now we have food,” he happily told Banag. He removed the golden covers of the grains, as the grasses had instructed him, cooked the grains and eat them. The next morning, Danas returned to the field, plant our grains “sang the grasses.” Plant them on land softened by rain. They will grow, and you will take care of them. When you harvest, save some grains to plant again. Learn to plant and take care of plants. Planting will become your source of livelihood.

                            8. LEVEL 3: ADVANCE 	Advance your skills! 	As a critical thinker, one should know how to analyze statements and draw conclusions from them. In this way, misunderstanding can be avoided. 	Your next task is to make or draw out a claim of value from each given argument. Example:	The world has sped up over the past generation; technology has gotten more complicated and ideas more complex. Hence, higher math like Algebra should be introduced as early as grades 7 and 8. However, children in grades 7 and 8 are experiencing plateau growth. They are not in their optimal years of learning, thus the growing number of failing students. Claim of Value: It is better to introduce higher math like Algebra in grade 10 instead. 	Dealing with unruly siblings can be maddening. Sometimes, we tend to easily lose our control and we wouldn’t notice we’re already raising our voices up to our ceiling. However, yelling towards our siblings is a costly mistake. Yelling only works in the moment. It can also cause our siblings to secretly dislike us. Another is, when we yell, we only train them to listen to us only when we raise our voice. No matter how frustrated you may get with your siblings, yelling should never be or should be the least of your option/s. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	‘Dark’ is a mind-bending and meticulously crafted TV series. It is arguably the best time travel show that I have witnessed. It doesn’t limit itself to that theme alone. It also tackles quantum entanglement, parallel, and alternative universe. Predictability does not count in the series. There will always be revelations. The plot is indeed perplexing but decently maintained all throughout. Overall, I must say, it’s a great show to binge watch. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	The library is a place for readers to explore, create, relax, and simply be. It is a window to investigate and see the world. The experience transforms readers from the narrow existence of daily life to the wide world beyond our brick and mortar walls. Public libraries play a very important role in fostering the intellectual development of society. It is one of the critical links to different institutions in our society, such as schools. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	Divorce should never be legalized in our country. It is not the answer to marital problems. It threatens the sanctity of marriage. The proposition will actually increase the number of failed marriages. It can also introduce the child to destructive behavior. The existence of divorce will also mean loss of faith in marriage and family unit. Divorce takes a toll on a family’s income which may lead to poverty aggravation. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ Filipinos have been a fan of beauty pageants. Beauty pageants have been entertaining us for the past decades. 		However, I believe beauty pageants degrade women. Women in such competitions are treated as physical objects for pleasure and not as human beings. They are judged based on their physical attributes mostly. They spend more time parading in swimsuits and gowns and very little time on intelligence. Claim of Value: ​</h2><br />

Don’t meddle with old unloaded firearms, they are the most deadly and unerring things ever created. You don’t have to take any pains with them at all; you don’t have to have a rest, you don’t have to have any sights on the gun, you don’t have to take aim even. No, you just pick out a relative and bang away, and you are sure to get him. A youth who can’t hit a cathedral at thirty yards with a Gatling gun in three-quarters of an hour, can take up an old empty musket and bag his grandmother every time at a hundred. ---Mark Twain, “Advice to Youth” In The Oracles: My Filipino Grandparents in America, Pati Poblete gives her account as a young girl growing up in America being raised by her culturally foreign grandparents, and the results reverberate with her well into her adult years. Her parents, on the other hand, play a deafeningly silent role throughout the upbringing of Pati. The failure of Pati’s parents to provide her with guidance, attention and to control her exposure to popular media at a young age prevented her from having a healthy relationship with her grandparents and a healthy identity. Ron Taffel, a child-rearing expert, advised: “Even as kids reach adolescence, they need more than ever for us to watch over them. Adolescence is not about letting go. It's about hanging on during a very bumpy ride.” Pati unfortunately didn’t have this support so seemed to hit every bump. ---Student paper on Pati Poblete’s The Oracles:My Filipino Grandparents in America In the 1940s, George Orwell warned “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past” (Orwell 30). In the 1990s a band called Rage Against the Machine, the name itself referring to a people’s movement to fight against control (corporation, government or otherwise) used this mantra in their song “Testify,” a warning to not silently endure oppression. This warning is not only relevant to the 20th century, but has been applicable since human beings started forming structures of power to control and oppress one another. This can vividly be seen during the times of slavery in the United States when blacks were enslaved for two and a half centuries. In Frederick Douglass’s novel Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Douglass reveals how this long and brutal control of human beings w​</h2><br />

Legalize Use of Medical Marijuana Think of the hopeful possibilities, the ways by which medical marijuana may ease a patient’s, and consequently a family’s suffering, and enhance palliative care for end-stage illnesses. Physicians, nurses, and caregivers have been pushing marijuana or cannabis as a medical recourse to mitigate pain in many patients afflicted with grave illnesses and medical conditions. While further intensive research is still needed, there is much anecdotal evidence to back marijuana’s palliative qualities. It has been touted worldwide as a compassionate aid for the terminally ill and the elderly. In the House of Representatives, the recent endorsement by the committee on the health of the proposed Philippine Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act raises hope among patients, advocacy groups, and other interested parties that the measure would soon reach plenary, be improved, and approved in a vote, and ultimately, with the Senate passing its version, be streamlined and finally enacted into law. Lawmakers are crossing party lines to endorse it. Authored by Isabela Rep. Rodolfo Albano III, the bill proposes that the state “legalize and regulate the medical use of cannabis, which has been confirmed to have beneficial and therapeutic uses to treat a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition that produces one or more of the following: cachexia or wasting syndrome; severe and chronic pain; severe nausea; seizures, including but not limited to those characteristics of epilepsy; or severe and persistent muscle spasms, including but not limited to those associated with multiple sclerosis.” The proposed law would enable “medical cannabis compassionate centers” under license by the Department of Health to sell, supply, and dispense the psychoactive drug to qualified patients or their designated caregivers by a pharmacist licensed by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. The bill has met opposition from various quarters citing possible abuse. But medical marijuana has notable supporters, including President Duterte himself. “Medicinal marijuana, yes, because it is an ingredient of modern medicine. There are medicines being developed, or are now in the market that contains marijuana for medical purposes,” the President was quoted as saying in 2016. Another high-profile supporter is former health secretary Jaime Galvez Tan, who told Congress that using cannabis is “a safer and cheaper way to treat patients” suffering from epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Marijuana has long been considered the most accessible gateway drugs. The belief was that marijuana would lead users to “graduate” too dangerous drugs such as heroin and cocaine. Its users have long been demonized as “stoners” and pejoratively described as lost souls who do nothing but smoke “weed” throughout the day. This remains its stereotypical portrayal in popular culture. Explaining his measure, Albano said: “It is evident in the bill that you can’t smoke weed per se. You cannot even dispense it in its raw form and say, ‘Just use this for tea.’ It has to be in medicinal form.” In a 2012 global drug report commissioned by the United Nations, marijuana was identified as “the world’s most widely produced, trafficked, and consumed drug in the world in 2010.” Its users' number between 119 million and 224 million among adults (18 or older) in the world. It is widely illegal worldwide. The United States, where marijuana was the poster child of the Reagan-era “Just Say No” anti-drug campaign, has made a severe turnaround regarding medical marijuana. Today,its usage is legal in 33 states. Canada was the first country to make it legal in 2001, and 32 other countries have followed suit. Hopefully, the Philippines will soon be part of the enlightened list. An efficient information campaign will help Filipinos understand that medical marijuana is a humane and perhaps even a necessary tool in helping those afflicted with painful or life- threatening diseases or conditions. Legally and properly administered, it will usher in a new and helpful realm of medical possibilities​</h2><br />
