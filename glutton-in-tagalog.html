                        <strong>Sitio Katamakawan</strong><p>Question 1: </p><p>No, there overall behavior about values and such weren’t that much of a problem but all those things about living a lazy and unhealthy lifestyle every single day are very tiring and not beneficial to your mind and body. Though values and respect are there you can almost do that even if you are working diligently and eating healthy or even doing activities to preserve your own health.
</p><p>Question 2: </p><p>These are the Dimensions of <strong>Health</strong>:
</p>Physical- our body’s overall health
Mental- our mental health focuses on our emotions and how our brain perceives and take thoughts
Spiritual- grabbing hold onto faith and religion and using that to strengthen beliefs, being one with things
Intellectual- maintaining a sharp mind by learning and making use of our brain to do almost anything  Social- being active in socializing or establishing communication to other people
Emotional-controlling our emotions and making it our own advantage
<p>The dimension of <strong>health </strong>that was sustained or met by the community Sitio Katamakawan is Spiritual. For the other dimensions mentioned above, they were quite difficult to see. Spiritual, because they still somewhat make time to go to church and have respect for other people. But they don’t have a healthy emotional, intellectual, physical, mental health since they are mostly stuck on playing virtual games or lazing around.  </p><p>Question 3: </p><p>No, they do not in fact they live the exact opposite of a physically active and healthy lifestyle. Examples are:
</p><p>The lazy around
</p>They eat almost everything they wanted without thinking of its side effects to their own body
They use other people to do their own chores
Teenagers’ minds are mostly into playing games and surfing the internet
<p>Question 4: </p><p>Possibly:
</p>Obesity- due to eating too much
Diabetes- maybe by consuming too much sugar
Heart Failure- too much fat consumption
High Blood Pressure- the result of being overweight
Cancer (for a most severe and long term unhealthy lifestyle)- maybe in kidneys, uterine or liver
<p>Question 5:  </p>The risk factor of Obesity is gaining other diseases that are highly related to this case such as High Blood Pressure.
Diabetes increases the sugar content of our body and makes us susceptible to other injuries and diseases
Heart Failure can lead to the clogging or stopping of the heart worst-case scenario. Our heart functions perfectly because of our healthy living, do the opposite and it will lead to a heavy burden.
High Blood Pressure occurs for a long time and there isn’t a stated thing that will cure it permanently of a person.

<p>Question 6:
</p><p>If I were to have a friend there in Sitio Katamakawan, I would advise him to not follow other people’s lifestyle and maybe tell him the risks if he continues to live his life that way. He can start by stopping those things that he mostly does aside from going to church and being respectable to the elders.  </p><p>He needs to clear his own fridge out of junk and too much fatty food and replace it with greens and less fatty meats. Then he needs to stop using technologies for hours, lessen their usage time and do some physical exercises.
</p><p>Question 7: </p>The advantages of technology is that it allows us to respond to our <strong>health</strong> needs and keeping track of it by simply searching and using technology to advise us about what are the best options to achieve a healthy lifestyle.
The disadvantage of technology is the same freedom it gives us to mostly do everything by the use of it. We can be so engrossed in using technology due to its convenience we expose ourselves to harmful stuff from it and we have less time to actually maintain our physical health.
<p>Question 8:</p>For the children, they can play outside the thought of “to avoiding accidents” is very primitive and constricting. Accidents happen even indoors you can’t actually prevent it for everybody.  For teenagers, they can start doing physical exercises or exercise their own brains by studying and reading books.
For adults, they can also engage themselves in physical exercises and watch what they eat.
