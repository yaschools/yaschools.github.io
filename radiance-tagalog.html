Fill in the missing boxes with the appropriate information. 1. Fernando Amorsolo (1892-1972) is often known as the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art". The Spanish-trained realist developed a backlighting technique, where his colorful depictions of local people reflect the radiance of the Philippine sun. The figures and illuminated landscapes magically glow on the canvas. Despite his deteriorating health and failing eyesight, he remained prolific until the end, producing up to 10 paintings a month until his death at the age of 80. Amorsolo's creativity defines the nation's culture and heritage to this day.Fernando AmorsoloKnown as the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art"10 paintings(1).80yrs. old(2).​</a>

Tiny buds on slender stemsBut if you pluck them before they flower,My plant will wither away, you know.5Hey there, maiden at the loom,What cloth are you weaving?Oh, need you ask, in these thin times?It’s cotton coverlet for me.</a>

Fill in the missing boxes with the appropriate information 1. Fernando Amorsolo (1892-1972) is often known as the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art". The Spanish-trained realist developed a backlighting technique, where his colorful depictions of local people reflect the radiance of the Philippine sun. The figures and illuminated landscapes magically glow on the canvas Despite his deteriorating health and failing eyesight, he remained prolific until the end, producing up to 10 paintings a month until his death at the age of 80. Amorsolo's creativity defines the nation's culture and heritage to this day.pa help po plsss ​</a>

Fernando Amorsolo (1892-1972) is often known as the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art". The Spanish-trained realist developed a backlighting technique, where his colorful depictions of local people reflect the radiance of the Philippine sun. The figures and illuminated landscapes magically glow on the canvas. Despite his deteriorating health and failing eyesight, he remained prolific until the end, producing up to 10 paintings a month until his death at the age of 80. Amorsolo's creativity defines the nation's culture and heritage to this day.Fernando AmorsoloKnown as the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art"10 paintings(1).80yrs. old(2).​</h2><br />

What is the theme of the poem?3.How would you describe the structure of the poem?4 What imagery is developed in the poem? 5. What Literary Criticism approach is the best to use in the poem?Twas on a Holy Thursday their innocent faces clean The children walking two &amp; two in red &amp; blue &amp; green Grey-headed beadles walkd before with wands as white as snow,Till into the high dome of Pauls they like Thames waters flow O what a multitude they seemd these flowers of London town Seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own The hum of multitudes was there but multitudes of lambs Thousands of little boys &amp; girls raising their innocent hands Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of Heaven among Beneath them sit the aged men wise guardians of the poor Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door​</h2><br />
                        ANSWER<p></p><p>1. The speaker of the poem is William Blake, who is narrating the scene of a Holy Thursday procession in London.</p><p></p><p>2. The theme of the poem is the contrast between the innocence and vulnerability of the children and the oppression of the poor in society. It also highlights the importance of compassion and pity towards the less fortunate.</p><p></p><p>3. The poem consists of four stanzas with a regular meter and rhyme scheme, giving it a structured and rhythmic flow. Each stanza focuses on a different aspect of the scene, starting with the procession, then the children, the singing, and finally the message of compassion.</p><p></p><p>4. The poem develops two main types of imagery. The first is visual imagery, particularly the colors of the children's clothes and the white wands of the beadles. The second is auditory imagery, particularly in the descriptions of the children's singing and the sound of their innocent hands raised in prayer.</p><p></p><p>5. The best literary criticism approach to use in this poem is a social and historical analysis. The poem reflects the social and economic conditions of London in Blake's time, particularly the poverty and oppression of the poor. It also reflects Blake's own political and religious beliefs, which emphasized the importance of compassion and social justice.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The poet is the speaker of the poem.</p><p>2 .The theme of a poem is the message an author wants to communicate through the piece. The theme differs from the main idea because the main idea describes what the text is mostly about. Supporting details in a text can help lead a reader to the main idea.</p><p>3.The structure of a poem involves many elements, such as the number of lines, the number of syllables in each line, the rhyming of certain words and phrases with others, and much more.</p><p>4.picture</p><p>5.One could argue that the best critical approach to literature is formalist criticism. Formalism examines the formal features of a text, such as the style, diction, and, in the case of poetry, rhythm, cadence, and rhyme. This laser-like focus on the text arguably gives the reader a better understanding of what is being discussed.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here’s how you can reflect God’s radiance in your life:</p><p></p><p>"Give your all to the One who gave His all for you" . Consider how much love God gives to you – so much that He was willing to come to Earth as Jesus to die for your sins to save you. Then let your gratitude for God’s supremely generous love motivate you to devote yourself to Him wholeheartedly. When you make your relationship with God the center of your life, revolving everything else around it, all will be properly balanced for God’s blessings to flow unhindered into your life. Be willing to faithfully follow where God leads you – even when doing so will be inconvenient or painful – trusting God’s promise that He wants what’s best for you.</p><br />
