                    <p>affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter&#039;s disobedience to the Immortal Laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar has disobeyed the Immortal Laws. The sea god, who was also angered by his son&#039;s disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves. Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of the cave, but he could not. He struggled so hard that he shook the walls of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar she would rush out in her golden chariot to the meeting place in the hope of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. &quot;It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,&quot; they say.  translate in tagalog​</p>

                                            Uwang and Salagubang “Uwang” (Rhinoceros Beetle in English) is one of the few beetles called by name in the Philippines. Other beetles are referred to as “salagubang", the generic Tagalog word for beetle. Although we can see various pictures of Rhinoceros Beetle online, nothing can compare to seeing one up close and personal. From experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it's really impossible to get it off easily. The variety found in the Philippines is the Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle. They may seem formidable and vicious, but appearance can be deceiving. They have sharp claws and those claws can only hurt you if you get pinched by them. Other than that, they are practically harmless. They also have horns and there is a difference in length depending on whether it's a male or female. From what I understand, it's the strongest insect in the world. I'm not willing to test the assertion. 1. What are the names of the two types of beetles which are found in the Philippines? 2. What variety of beetles do those two types come from? 3. How did the author describe the claws of "uwang" and "salagubang" ? 4.

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </a>

Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar has disobeyed the Immortal Laws. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves. Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of the cave, but he could not. He struggled so hard that he shook the walls of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad.

Ang diyos ng dagat, na nagalit din sa pagsuway ng kanyang anak, ay ikinulong siya sa isa sa kanyang mga kweba ng dagat. Nanatili si Luna sa hardin ng ilang oras. Nalungkot siya nang hindi makita si Mar. Nais niyang makasama itong muli. Pakiramdam niya ay hindi mapakali isang araw, nakatakas siya mula sa hardin. Kinuha niya ang kanyang gintong karwahe at nagmamadaling pumunta sa kanilang tagpuan. Nakita ni Mar, na nakakulong sa kweba ng dagat, ang kanyang repleksyon sa tubig. Gusto niyang lumabas para salubungin siya. Sinubukan niyang makaalis sa kweba, ngunit hindi niya magawa. Nagpumiglas siya kaya niyanig niya ang mga dingding ng kanyang kweba na nagdulot ng kaguluhan sa dagat. Hinintay ni Luna na lumitaw si Mar, ngunit hindi siya dumating. Pagkatapos ay umuwi siyang malungkot. Sa tuwing naaalala niya si Mar ay nagmamadali siyang papalabas sa kanyang gintong kalesa patungo sa tagpuan sa pag-asang makita siyang muli.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The uwang (in English, the Rhinoceros Beetle) is one of the few beetles called by name in the Philippines. Other beetles are referred to as salagubang, the generic Tagalog word for beetle.
</p><p>
</p><p>Although you can find various pictures online of the Rhinoceros Beetle, nothing can compare to seeing one up close and personal. From experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it's nearly impossible to get it off without killing it. The variety found in the Philippines is the Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle.
</p><p>
</p><p>They may seem formidable and vicious, but appearances can be deceiving. They have sharp claws, and those claws can only hurt you if you get pinched by them. Other than that, they're practically harmless. They also have horns, and there is a difference in length depending on whether it's male or female.
</p><p>
</p><p>From what I understand, it's the strongest insect in the world. I'm not willing to test that assertion.
</p><p>
</p><p>Beetles of All Kinds
</p><p>There are beetles in the Philippines that I've never seen anywhere else in the world, and I'd be lying if I told you I could name any of them. There are also beetles in the Philippines who could be considered "undocumented immigrants" from the United States, hitching rides on cargo ships and airplanes. Of course, I'm sure they come from other places as well, like Korea, Japan and China.
</p><p>
</p><p>Interestingly, a bilas of mine (a sister-in-law's husband) has a sister who was given the nickname of "Ubang" when she was young, which is short for salagubang. It took me a while to figure out it was because she was afraid of beetles when she was young, not because she looks like one (she doesn't, of course).
</p><p>
</p><p>Beetle Pest Control
</p><p>There really isn't any way to control these little creatures without causing environmental damage. They won't normally go where people go unless they're seeking a new food source (certain plants and trees). They usually only get into houses when people leave their doors open. The uwang is too big to fit under the bottom of most doors when the doors are properly closed.
</p><p>
</p><p>It's important to have bug screens on window frames and trust me, you can find houses in the Philippines with window frames only, without anything in the frames. During the cool months, windows aren't that important, but bug screens are always important, and not just to keep beetles out. I'm also talking about mosquitoes, dragonflies and praying mantises, all of which have entered my house when doors or windows were open.
</p><p>
</p><p>Years ago, one of my young nieces (a teenager today) was jumping around hysterically, crying and whining at the same time. It took a minute or more to realize which of the beetles had attached it to the backside of the t-shirt she was wearing. Removing her t-shirt from her body was far easier than removing the uwang from her t-shirt. It didn't want to let go.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>These are drugs that people use initially that may eventually lead to abuse of illegal drugs</strong><strong></strong><p>Addiction is a chronic condition defined by compulsive or difficult-to-control substance seeking and use, despite adverse effects. Most people make the decision to use <strong>drugs</strong> voluntarily at first, but chronic <strong>drug</strong> use can cause brain changes that test an addict's self-control and make it difficult to resist strong <strong>drug </strong>cravings. These brain alterations can last a long time, which is why <strong>drug </strong>addiction is referred to as a "relapsing" disease: people in recovery from <strong>drug </strong>use disorders are more likely to relapse after years of abstinence.</p><p>It's typical for people to relapse, but it doesn't indicate treatment isn't effective.

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Noong unang panahon, ang mga diyos lamang ang nabubuhay sa mundong ito, ang lupa, dagat, at langit ay pinamumunuan ng tatlong magkakaibang</p><p>makapangyarihang mga diyos. Ang diyos ng araw, na namuno sa langit, ay may isang napakagandang anak na babae, si Luna, ang buwan. Nag-enjoy si Luna</p><p>umiikot sa langit sakay ng kanyang gintong karo. Isang araw natagpuan niya ang kanyang sarili na tumahak sa ibang landas na humantong</p><p>sa labas ng kanyang kaharian. Naglakad-lakad siya hanggang sa marating niya ang lugar kung saan sinalubong ng langit ang dagat Maganda</p><p>at hindi pangkaraniwang tanawin ang sumalubong sa kanyang mga mata.</p><p>Habang hinahangaan niya ang mga magagandang bagay sa paligid, isang boses ang bumulaga sa kanya. Nagtanong ito, “Saan ka pupunta</p><p>galing sa pinaka maganda?" Paglingon niya ay nakita niya ang isang binata na kamukha ng kanyang ama</p><p>mas patas. Gusto niyang tumakas, ngunit nang muli siyang tumingin sa kanya, nakita niyang nakangiti ito sa kanya. Pagkuha</p><p>lakas ng loob niyang sumagot, "Ako si Luna, anak ng diyos ng araw." Ngumiti sa kanya ang binata at sumagot, “I</p><p>Ako si Mar, ang anak ng diyos ng dagat. Maligayang pagdating sa aming kaharian." Hindi nagtagal ay naging matalik na magkaibigan ang dalawa. Marami silang kawili-wiling kwento na sasabihin. Kapag oras na para sa</p><p>Luna to go, nangakong magkikita sila nang madalas hangga't maaari, dahil marami pa silang kwento sila</p><p>Nagpatuloy ang pagkikita sa iisang lugar hanggang sa napagtanto nilang in love na sila sa isa't isa.</p><p>Isang araw pagkatapos ng isa sa kanilang mga lihim na pagkikita, bumalik si Luna sa langit na puno ng kagalakan. Siya ay gayon</p><p>masaya na sinabi niya ang sikreto niya sa isa niyang pinsan. Ang pinsan, naninibugho sa kanyang kagandahan at kanyang kaligayahan, iniulat ang relasyon sa diyos ng araw. Nagalit ang diyos ng araw sa pagsuway ng kanyang anak sa imortal</p><p>mga batas. Isinara niya siya sa kanilang hardin at hindi siya pinayagang makalabas. Pagkatapos ay umuwi siyang malungkot. Sa tuwing naaalala niya si Mar, nagmamadali siyang lumabas sa ginto</p><p>kalesa patungo sa tagpuan sa pag-asang makita siyang muli. Ang mga mangingisda sa labas ng dagat ay naniniwala na sa bawat oras</p><p>Lumilitaw si Luna, ang buwan, nagugulo ang dagat. Si Mar ang sumusubok na tumakas sa kanyang kweba,” sabi nila.</p><br />
