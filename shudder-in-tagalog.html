                                            An allegory is a story that uses characters and settings as symbols that carry a deeper meaning beyond the obvious meaning of the story. Which excerpt from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s "Dr. Heidegger's Experiment" best reveals the allegorical nature of this short story?
 A. A strange chillness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm.
 B. But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.
 C. Then all shouted mirthfully, and leaped about the room. The Widow Wycherly—if so fresh a damsel could be called a widow—tripped up to the doctor's chair, with a mischievous merriment in her rosy face.
 D. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</a>

                                            THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT Mrs. Santos was a widow who was left with three young boys to take care of. Her husband had left her with a very meager savings not enough to bring up their children comfortably and decently. To the best of her ability, she tried to raise them in a God-fearing home. She worked hard by washing clothes and selling rice cakes in the neighborhood. She tried to save too for the rainy days. Mrs. Santos had trouble with one of her sons. He always find the secret places where she hid her money and would take from it the amount he wanted. This happened several times and no amount of scolding or punishment could change the boy. Finally, in desperation, the mother got a piece of paper and printed on it in bold letters, "Thou shalt not steal." Placing it on top of the box which contained the money, she hid it in a new place. Again, the boy found the box where the money was kept. He saw and read the piece of paper with The Sixth Commandment written on it. The good within him prevailed over his mischief. He shuddered at the thought that he would again be breaking God's commandment. He laid down the box without opening it and left feeling guilty for his past deeds. A few days later, upon returning from the market, the mother noticed that the box had again been found. Everything inside it, however, was intact. Not a centavo was missing. "Incredibly true, everything accounted for," she mused. The boy saw his mother examining the box. Quickly he approached her, knelt down before her, and begged for forgiveness. The mother was touched by the boy's act of repentance. She told him, "My son, I know that God within you will not allow you to do such a thing. Your good self will always prevail over your folly. From now on, always think several times before doing something. Ask yourself, "Will I be breaking one of God's commandments?" By living up to God's commandment you can never go wrong."Questions:1. What was Mrs. Santos' problem?2. Describe the sixth commandment.3. How did the son ask for forgiveness?4. Aside from washing clothes, how else did Mrs. Santos earn some money?5. What kind of a mother is Mrs. Santos?6. How do you think will her sons grow up?7. What advice can you give to the kids who go against the sixth commandment?​</a>

Into his darker musings, with a mild 
And healing sympathy, that steals away 
Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts 
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight 
Over thy spirit, and sad images 
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall. 
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house, 
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart--

In this excerpt from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s "Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment," which two sentences best summarize the passage?
His guests shivered again. A strange chillness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm, and left a deepening furrow where none had been before. Was it an illusion? Had the changes of a lifetime been crowded into so brief a space, and were they now four aged people, sitting with their old friend, Dr. Heidegger?
"Are we grown old again, so soon?" cried they, dolefully.
In truth they had. The Water of Youth possessed merely a virtue more transient than that of wine. The delirium which it created had effervesced away. Yes! they were old again. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.
"Yes, friends, ye are old again," said Dr. Heidegger, "and lo! the Water of Youth is all lavished on the ground. Well, I bemoan it not; for if the fountain gushed at my very doorstep, I would not stoop to bathe my lips in it; no, though its delirium were for years instead of moments. Such is the lesson ye have taught me!"
But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.</a>

 A. A strange chillness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm.
 B. But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.
 C. Then all shouted mirthfully, and leaped about the room. The Widow Wycherly—if so fresh a damsel could be called a widow—tripped up to the doctor's chair, with a mischievous merriment in her rosy face.
 D. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</h2><br />

With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</p><p>This excerpt reveals the allegorical nature of the story because it shows that the character of the widow is symbolic of the idea of aging and the loss of beauty. She wishes that the coffin-lid were over her face, since it could be no longer beautiful, which is a metaphor for death and the end of life. This passage is showing how the characters in the story are symbols for deeper concepts and ideas.</p><br />

                            5. THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT Mrs. Santos was a widow who was left with three young boys to take care of. Her husband had left her with a very meager savings not enough to bring up their children comfortably and decently. To the best of her ability, she tried to raise them in a God-fearing home. She worked hard by washing clothes and selling rice cakes in the neighborhood. She tried to save too for the rainy days. Mrs. Santos had trouble with one of her sons. He always find the secret places where she hid her money and would take from it the amount he wanted. This happened several times and no amount of scolding or punishment could change the boy. Finally, in desperation, the mother got a piece of paper and printed on it in bold letters, "Thou shalt not steal." Placing it on top of the box which contained the money, she hid it in a new place. Again, the boy found the box where the money was kept. He saw and read the piece of paper with The Sixth Commandment written on it. The good within him prevailed over his mischief. He shuddered at the thought that he would again be breaking God's commandment. He laid down the box without opening it and left feeling guilty for his past deeds. A few days later, upon returning from the market, the mother noticed that the box had again been found. Everything inside it, however, was intact. Not a centavo was missing. "Incredibly true, everything accounted for," she mused. The boy saw his mother examining the box. Quickly he approached her, knelt down before her, and begged for forgiveness. The mother was touched by the boy's act of repentance. She told him, "My son, I know that God within you will not allow you to do such a thing. Your good self will always prevail over your folly. From now on, always think several times before doing something. Ask yourself, "Will I be breaking one of God's commandments?" By living up to God's commandment you can never go wrong."Questions:1. What was Mrs. Santos' problem?2. Describe the sixth commandment.3. How did the son ask for forgiveness?4. Aside from washing clothes, how else did Mrs. Santos earn some money?5. What kind of a mother is Mrs. Santos?6. How do you think will her sons grow up?7. What advice can you give to the kids who go against the sixth commandment?​</h2><br />

                            7. What two words or phrases in this excerpt from "Thanatopsis" by William Cullen Bryant best help to reveal the meaning of the word blight as it is used in the poem?
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile 
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides 
Into his darker musings, with a mild 
And healing sympathy, that steals away 
Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts 
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight 
Over thy spirit, and sad images 
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall. 
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house, 
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart-- 
Go forth, under the open sky, and list 
To Nature's teachings,
pls answer</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>"last bitter hour" and "stern agony" </strong>are the two phrases that best help to reveal the meaning of the word "blight" as it is used in the poem because they both describe negative and overwhelming experiences that can cause one to feel despair. In this context, "blight" refers to a negative influence or event that can cause harm to one's mental and emotional state, much like how a plant disease can cause harm to a plant. The imagery of the "last bitter hour" and "stern agony" creates a sense of fear and dread, and it is implied that these thoughts can have a detrimental effect on one's well-being, much like how a blight can harm a plant. So the word 'blight' in the poem refers to the negative thoughts and feeling that are associated with the idea of death and final hour.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"last bitter hour" and "stern agony"</p><p></p><br />

In this excerpt from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s "Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment," which two sentences best summarize the passage?
His guests shivered again. A strange chillness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm, and left a deepening furrow where none had been before. Was it an illusion? Had the changes of a lifetime been crowded into so brief a space, and were they now four aged people, sitting with their old friend, Dr. Heidegger?
"Are we grown old again, so soon?" cried they, dolefully.
In truth they had. The Water of Youth possessed merely a virtue more transient than that of wine. The delirium which it created had effervesced away. Yes! they were old again. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.
"Yes, friends, ye are old again," said Dr. Heidegger, "and lo! the Water of Youth is all lavished on the ground. Well, I bemoan it not; for if the fountain gushed at my very doorstep, I would not stoop to bathe my lips in it; no, though its delirium were for years instead of moments. Such is the lesson ye have taught me!"
But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The two sentences that best summarize the passage from Nathaniel Hawthorne's "Dr. Heidegger's Experiment" are:</strong></p><p>"Are we grown old again, so soon?" cried they, dolefully.</p><p>In truth they had.</p><p></p><p>These two sentences summarize the passage because they convey the main theme of the story, which is the fleeting nature of youth and the inevitability of aging. The first sentence expresses the surprise and disappointment of the characters as they realize that they have aged again so soon. This is a key moment in the story as it highlights the disappointment of the characters and their realization that the Water of Youth they had consumed had a temporary effect on their youthfulness.</p><p></p><p><strong>The second sentence confirms </strong>that the characters have indeed aged again, and it serves to reinforce the main theme of the story that youth is transient and that aging is inevitable.</p><p></p><p><strong>The following sentence</strong> "Yes, friends, ye are old again," said Dr. Heidegger, "and lo! the Water of Youth is all lavished on the ground. Well, I bemoan it not; for if the fountain gushed at my very doorstep, I would not stoop to bathe my lips in it; no, though its delirium were for years instead of moments. Such is the lesson ye have taught me!" is an elaboration of the theme of fleeting nature of youth and the inevitability of aging and Dr. Heidegger's perspective towards it, it also serves as a moral lesson to the characters.</p><p></p><p><strong>In summation,</strong> these two sentences serve as a summary of the passage by capturing the main theme of the story, which is the fleeting nature of youth and the inevitability of aging, and how the characters react to this realization.</p><p></p><p><strong>`It would be greatly appreciated if you could rate my answer and mark it as the brainliest one.</strong></p><br />
